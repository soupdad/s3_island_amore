# s3_mc "The person I want to couple up with is..."
# s3_mc "Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ/Ciaran/Tai/Yasmin!"
# "Everything is on the up..."
# "The Islanders wake up."
# Liona "Morning, gorgeous."
# "And Ciaran thinks the others are making stuff up..."
# ciaran "What on earth is brunch?"
# "Poor sweet Ciaran."
# "I'd cook you avocado toast any day of the week."
# "If I had avocados. Or a toaster."
# "But you know what they say. What goes up..."
# bff "But are they loyal?"
# "Must come down..."
# bff "I got a text!"

# You wipe away the sleep in your eyes.
# (Scene with Ciaran/Tai/Camilo/AJ):
# Tai/Ciaran/Camilo/AJ is tickling your nose with a feather.
# s3_mc "Ah, aah..."
# s3_mc "Choo!"
# You sneeze.
# C/T/Cam/aj "Oops."
# C/T/Cam/aj "Sorry!"
# C/T/Cam/aj "I just really wanted to wake you up with this feather."
# C/T/Cam/aj "It was stuck to you for ages and I just kept thinking of how much of an angel you were."
# s3_mc "So, you stuck it up my nose?"
# C/T/Cam/aj "Yeah..."
# Choiceseb "Tai/Ciaran/Camilo/AJ says I'm an angel."
# -Say some cheesy chat up line
# You peer around Tai's/Ciaran's/Camilo's/AJ's neck.
# C/T/Cam/aj "What are you doing?"
# s3_mc "Looking for the 'made in heaven' tag."
# C/T/Cam/aj "Is that a ladder in your tights or a stairway to heaven? (you get 😍 Tai/Ciaran/Camilo/AJ)"
# You stick your tongue out at Tai/Ciaran/Camilo/AJ.
# s3_mc "I'm not wearing any tights."
# C/T/Cam/aj "It's still funny."

# -Stick the feather up Ciaran's/Tai's/Camilo's/AJ's nose
# You grab the feather out of Ciaran's/Tai's/Camilo's/AJ's hand and tickle [him_her] right on the nose.
# C/T/Cam/aj "Ah, aah!"
# C/T/Cam/aj "Choo!"
# Nicky walks in and grabs his water bottle.
# nicky "Does someone keep sneezing in here?"
# C/T/Cam/aj "Yes, that would be us."
# C/T/Cam/aj "We're making each other sneeze because it's a cute thing to do."
# nicky "Sure you are..."
# nicky "Another day in paradise."
# nicky "I'll leave you two to it."
# He walks out again.
# Ciaran/Tai/Camilo laughs/AJ, a little nervously.

# -Cuddle up to [him_her]
# You brush the feather away and cuddle closer up to Ciaran/Tai/Camilo/AJ.

# (Scene with Bill/Harry/Yasmin):
# s3_mc "Morning, you."
# B/H/yasmin "Morning."
# A loose feather is stuck on Bill's/Harry's/Yasmin's nose.
# Choiceseb "I should..."
# -Just cuddle up to [him_her]
# You snuggle closer to Bill/Harry/Yasmin.
#  Bill/Harry/Yasmin brushes the feather off [his_her] nose.
# B/H/yasmin "You're the best cuddler ever. (you get 😍  Bill/Harry/Yasmin)"
# s3_mc "On a scale from one to ten?"
# B/H/yasmin "You're off the scale!"

# -Tickle [him_her] with the feather
# You grab the feather and tickle Bill/Harry/Yasmin right on the nose.
# [he_she] sneezes loudly.

# -Take it off for [him_her]
# You pick the feather of Bill's/Harry's/Yasmin's nose.
# [he_she] looks at you a little confused.
# B/H/yasmin "OK..."
# s3_mc "You had a feather on your nose."
# B/H/yasmin "Oh, it's one of those white ones."
# B/H/yasmin "I've heard you can make a wish on these."
# B/H/yasmin "I know exactly what I'm wishing for... (you get ❤️ with Bill/Harry/Yasmin)"
# B/H/yasmin "Want to know what it is?"
# Choiceseb "Do I want Bill/Harry/Yasmin to tell me what he's/she's wishing for?"
# -Yeah, go on!
#  Bill/Harry/Yasmin smiles.
# B/H/yasmin "I wish for more mornings like this one."
# B/H/yasmin "Being right here in your arms is all I could ever wish for."
# s3_mc "Aw, that's so sweet!"
#  Bill/Harry/Yasmin blows on the feather.
# It floats off in the bedroom.

# -Don't you mean 'who'?
# Bill/Harry/Yasmin smiles.
# B/H/yasmin "I wish for more mornings like this one."
# B/H/yasmin "Being right here in your arms is all I could ever wish for."
# s3_mc "Aw, that's so sweet!"
#  Bill/Harry/Yasmin blows on the feather.
# It floats off in the bedroom.

# -No, it might not come true
#  Bill/Harry/Yasmin smiles. 
# B/H/yasmin "Good thinking."
#  Bill/Harry/Yasmin blows on the feather.
# It floats off in the bedroom.

# [he_she] stretches his arms up, yawning loudly.
# As [his_her] arms come down, [he_she] wraps one around you.
# You lie in each other's arms for a while, watching LI's chest rise and fall with each breath.
# B/H/Cam/aj "I'm just so happy that we get to wake up next to each other in the morning."
# (MC coupled with Ciaran/Tai/Yasmin before):
# C/T/yasmin "I really love waking up next to you in the morning."
# C/T/yasmin "It's the best thing ever."
# (MC not coupled with Ciaran/Tai/Yasmin before):
# C/T/yasmin "I'm just so happy that we get to wake up next to each other in the morning."
# Choiceseb "LI likes waking up next to me!"
# -Me too, this is perfect
# LI smiles and strokes your cheek. (you get 😍 LI)

# -You should, I am a treasure
# s3_mc "You've just woken up at the end of the rainbow, hun."
# Liona "You crack me up. (you get 😂 with LI)"
# Liona "I hope you like what's in my pot of gold."

# -Great! Now can we make breakfast?
# Liona "We will, we will."
# Liona "I just want to say something."

# Liona "I wanted to say, like, I really can't tell you how happy I am that you picked me."
# Choiceseb "LI is pleased that I picked [him_her]..."
# -Reassure [him_her]
# LI grins and blushes a little. (you get 😍 LI)

# -Ask if [he_she] was nervous
# Liona "No."
# Liona "I don't want that to sound, like, arrogant."
# Liona "But I was pretty sure you'd pick me."

# -Joke about not wanting to choose anybody
# s3_mc "I was like, 'I'd rather go home than have to choose from these loser'."
# Liona "Really? (you get 🙁 with LI)"
# s3_mc "Nah."
# Liona "Phew!"

# Bill holds out his arms and you snuggle up close to him.
# bill "It's well nice being here with you."
# bill "Is it what you expected? I mean, is this how you imagined life in the Villa?"
# Choiceseb "Is the Villa what I expected?"
# -It's been really chill
# s3_mc "I was expecting a nice, chilled-out holiday, but it's been a lot of drama."
# bill "Yeah. I'm really not a fan of drama."

# -I thought there'd be more drama
# s3_mc "I was kind of expecting it to be some kind of unending firestorm of drama, but everyone is really nice."
# bill "Wow... deep."
# s3_mc "You have that effect on me."
# bill "You thought it was all drama-free? What happened on day one?"
# s3_mc "Miki was really just playing the game."
# bill "I agree. I don't get on with drama."

# -I didn't expect to find someone like you
# s3_mc "I was expecting fun, flirty times and a free holiday."
# s3_mc "You kind of knocked me off my feet."
# He smiles back at you.
# bill "I could say the same."

# s3_mc "I love just being able to relax without doing any adulting."
# bill "What do you mean?"
# s3_mc "You know, pay your bills, go shopping, make the bed..."
# bill "Oh, I getcha. I barely even make my bed, though."
# s3_mc "You what?"
# bill "Just not necessary, is it? Nobody sees my bed during the day."
# bill "And if they do, they're not gonna care if it's a bit messy."
# Choiceseb "Bill has never made his bed..."
# -Right, it's just a waste of time
# s3_mc "People spend too much time on things that don't really have a point."
# bill "I knew you'd get me."

# -I don't agree with that at all
# s3_mc "It's just a part of life, you know?"
# s3_mc "You may as well not clean your house."
# bill "That's totally different. Not making your bed isn't dirty, is it? It's just saving your effort for things that matter."
# s3_mc "Hmm."

# -Didn't your mum make you when you were a kid?
# bill "Yeah, and it was a massive waste of time then, too."
# s3_mc "So what do you do with all the time you save not making your bed?"
# bill "Make a cuppa, obviously."
# bill "Means, I get it that little bit sooner in the day, and that's a lifesaver at times."

# s3_mc "So is there anything else you've never done?"
# bill "Nothing that matters. But if you're interested, let's see..."
# bill "I've never spent money on a book. Library's free, innit?"
# bill "I've never eaten a peach. It's just an apple being extra."
# bill "I've never had a salad with meat in it. Meat's a separate food."
# bill "I've never been to America. I've seen it on TV and that's enough."
# s3_mc "OK, OK, I think that's plenty!"
# Choiceseb "There seem to be a lot of things Bill's not done..."
# -I really admire the strength of your convictions
# s3_mc "Not many people know their own minds as much as you do."
# s3_mc "Even when I don't agree, I think it's really cool that you stick to your guns."
# s3_mc "Maybe I could try and change your mind on one or two things once we leave the island, though?"
# s3_mc "I think it could be fun."

# -Aren't you worried about missing out?
# bill "Not really. I don't need to eat a peach to know it's a weird apple, you know?"
# s3_mc "Yeah, but you might like some of these things."
# s3_mc "You might love peaches!"
# s3_mc "You'll never know until you try."

# -When we leave here, we're gonna do all these things together
# s3_mc "No buts. We're gonna try loads of new things, and you might even like some of them."

# Bill chews his lip.
# bill "This will sound weird, but, I feel like when people think 'Bill' they think 'the guy with the opinions'."
# s3_mc "What do you mean?"
# bill "I mean it's hard to change my mind on anything because I'm known for never doing that."
# bill "Sometimes I worry that I've backed myself into a bit of a corner."
# s3_mc "Well, maybe I can help you out of it. We can work on Bill 2.0 'the guy who keeps surprising you', what do you say?"
# Bill smiles, and reaches out to brush your hair with his fingertips.
# bill "Sounds great, babe."
# s3_mc "At least try a peach."

# harry "You're so beautiful, MC."
# harry "I just wanna treat you like a princess and shower you with gifts."
# Choiceseb "Harry wants to shower me with gifts..."
# -Relationships aren't about gifts
# -I love getting gifts
# harry "That's good, 'cause I love giving them."

# -Do I get to buy you gifts too?
# harry "Of course! I just think little presents are a great way to show you care."

# harry "It's because I'm a total bee."
# s3_mc "A bee?"
# harry "Yeah, it's one of the four Affection Animals. Have you heard of them before?"
# s3_mc "No, I haven't."
# harry "Basically, it's a way of categorising people based on how they give and receive love and affection."
# harry "I'm a bee. We work, we build and give as a way of showing our partners how we feel."
# harry "Then you've got Wolves, who show their affection through being present. Standing guard, staying loyal, spending quality time together."
# harry "Dolphins are communicative and friendly. They tend to be the first to say 'I love you'."
# harry "And then you've got Octopuses. Octopi. Octopeese?"
# s3_mc "I don't think it's octopeese."
# harry "It's 'geese', isn't it?"
# s3_mc "That's totally different."
# harry "OK, whatever. If you're an Octopus, you're all about physical touch, sex and that."
# s3_mc "I see."
# harry "So which do you think you are?"
# Choiceseb "I'm definitely"
# -An Octopus
# -A Dolphin
# harry "Nice. I've almost dared Dolphins in the past."
# s3_mc "So that's why they don't let you into the aquarium anymore?"
# He laughs.
# harry "Seriously though, I do tend to get on well with Dolphin-type people. I like how up-front they are."
# harry "Sometimes Dolphin/Bee relationships can lack physical intimacy, but I don't think we have that problem."

# -A Bee
# Harry grins broadly.
# harry "That's like me! That's good news for our compatibility."
# harry "Two bees tend to have awesome adventures and do a lot together."
# harry "But we've got to be careful that we don't rely on actions too much and forget to communicate clearly."

# -A Wolf
# harry "Cool. Wolves and Bees are meant to get on well, especially when it comes to starting a family and building a home together."
# He blushes.
# harry "I mean, not saying we're definitely there yet or anything, but... you know."
# harry "But we've got to be careful we don't focus too much on each other and neglect our other relationships."

# Choiceseb "This system..."
# -Makes no sense at all
# -Makes a lot of sense
# harry "Yeah, I really like it. It can tell you a lot about you and your partner."
# harry "I'm not into all stuff like that. I think dividing people up based on their personality is mega fun."

# -Would work better with fruit
# harry "Fruit? How would that work? Dolphins are talkative.. What's a talkative fruit?"
# Choiceseb "Easy. That's a... (no further reactions)"
# -Pineapple
# -Star fruit
# -Watermelon
# harry "Why?"
# You shrug.

# s3_mc "Wait, don't tell me I'm the only one who has conversations with fruit?"
# Harry laughs.

# He weaves his fingers into yours and pulls you closer. You press up to his chest and he cuddles you tight.

# Camilo runs his fingers down your cheek and neck. The light touch leaves goosebumps on your skin.
# Choiceseb "Should I kiss him?"
# -No
# -Do the same back to him
# -Yes
# You drape your arms around his neck and tilt your head towards him.
# He kisses you slow and sweet, and for a moment the world melts away and there's only the two of you.
# At long last, he pulls away and gives you one of his incredible smiles before wrapping you in his arms.
# camilo "It's so weird to think that this'll all be coming to an end sooner or later."
# s3_mc "I don't want it to be over."
# camilo "Yeah... back to the real world..."
# camilo "Having to go down to the supermarket..."
# s3_mc "Having to work!"
# camilo "You're a scientist/model/pro athlete/musician, right?"
# s3_mc "Yeah, that's right."
# camilo "You like it?"
# Choiceseb "How do I feel about my job?"
# -It's fine, but not my dream job
# -I don't like it
# -I love it - it's my dream job
# s3_mc "Yup. Wouldn't change it for the world."
# s3_mc "It was basically all I've ever wanted to do since I was a little girl."
# s3_mc "The other day, my mum found all these pictures I'd drawn when I was five, and in every single one I was a scientist/model/pro athlete/musician."
# camilo "That's great."

# s3_mc "How do you feel about working in your family's shop?"
# camilo "I'm not gonna say I hate it, because I don't."
# camilo "I love chatting with people and that. Plus, I get to big up my mum's empanadas, which are lush."
# camilo "But it's not my dream job, you get me?"
# s3_mc "Why don't you do something else?"
# camilo "Not that easy, babe. I took over after my dad got ill. If I leave, who's gonna do it?"
# camilo "I'd proper love to try something else, but I just can't. It is what it is."
# Choiceseb "Camilo wishes he could leave his job..."
# -You don't have to be responsible for everyone
# -Don't you have a million family members, who could take over?
# -You deserve to be happy
# s3_mc "I think it's great that you're so into doing the right thing by your family."
# s3_mc "But, like... don't put everyone else above yourself."
# s3_mc "You get to prioritise yourself sometimes. I'm sure your family doesn't want you to support them at the cost of your happiness."

# camilo "But it's about, like, duty, innit?"
# camilo "It's like giving your word. You can't go back on it."
# Choiceseb "Camilo says he can't quit because he gave his word..."
# -I don't think it's so black-and-white
# -I'm sure your family would understand if you quit
# -That's so noble it hurts
# camilo "It's not like I'm some kinda saint."
# camilo "Just a bloke who does right by his family."

# s3_mc "So what would you do if you could do anything?"
# camilo "BJJ competitor?"
# camilo "I used to want to do that. But I think I enjoy it more as a hobby."
# camilo "I think now I'd want to be..."
# camilo "Actually, it's kind of a secret. Is it OK if I don't tell you right now?"
# s3_mc "Of course. I'd love to hear it one day, though."
# camilo "Definitely."

# aj "Ugh, I want to kiss you so bad."
# Choiceseb "AJ wants to kiss me."
# -Blow her a kiss
# -Kiss her softly
# You lean towards AJ. she closes her eyes again.
# Your lips gently touch for a moment. It's soft and earnest.
# You melt into one another for a few moments.
# Your hands explore each other's bodies as you rhythmically in sync with each other.
# Your heart flutters a little as you both pull away.
# aj "Wow! (you get ❤️ with AJ)"
# AJ You're such a good kisser.

# -Make out passionately
# Your lips touch and in an instant your hands are exploring her toned body.
# She lets out a small moan of pleasure, taking your wrists lightly, pulling you closer into her.
# You kiss her urgently. For a moment, her touch is all that matters until you both pull away.
# aj "Hot damn."
# aj "That was..."
# AJ seems a little bit out of breath.
# aj "Hot!"

# aj "Oh, I was wondering..."
# aj "You know, my usual general nosiness."
# aj "What kind of stuff gets you in the mood?"
# s3_mc "What kind of mood?"
# aj "You know, a sexy mood... in the bedroom."
# aj "My coach always says communication."
# s3_mc "Your coach said that to you in the bedroom?"
# AJ blushes and bursts out laughing.
# aj "No!"
# s3_mc "What's the one thing that gets you in the mood?"
# Choiceseb "What gets me in the mood..."
# -When someone plays with my hair
# -Just say my name three times while looking in a mirror 
# -I love it when people kiss my neck
# aj "Aw, really?"
# She leans in closer to you.
# aj "Mind if I kiss your neck now?"
# Choiceseb "AJ wants to kiss my neck!"
# -No thanks, not right now
# -Go for it
# She gently kisses you, sending shivers down your spine.
# s3_mc "Perfect."
# aj "I try."

# s3_mc "Hey, isn't it your birthday today?"
# aj "You remembered!"
# s3_mc "Of course."
# She hugs you tightly.
# Choiceseb "It's AJ's birthday!"
# -Sing happy birthday
# -Suggest birthday bits
# s3_mc "So, you up for some birthday bits?"

# -Give her a happy birthday kiss
# You lean in and kiss her on the cheek.

# She grins.
# aj "I already know this is going to be the best birthday ever."
# aj "I get to spend it with you."

# Tai's dark eyes crinkle with his smile.
# tai "I was just thinking about my dad. I hope he's having fun watching this."
# tai "Not, er, all of it, though."
# He leans closer, his gaze inviting.
# Choiceseb "Tai wants to kiss me!"
# -Not with his dad watching
# -Kiss him while looking for a camera
# You eye up your surroundings before leaning in and kissing Tai firmly on the mouth.
# Tai draws back and murmurs something you can't quite hear against your neck.
# s3_mc "Wait."
# You put your hand up over your faces like you're avoiding paparazzi.
# s3_mc "Now no one can see."
# He kisses very lightly down to the hollow of your throat, then along your collarbones.
# It's a little ticklish, but the sensation gives you shivers.
# When you break apart, you still feel warm from Tai's touch.
# His smile is wonderfully bright.

# -Kiss him
# You lose yourself in the kiss. Tai draws back and murmurs something you can't quite hear against your neck.
# He kisses very lightly down to the hollow of your throat, then along your collarbones.
# It's a little ticklish, but the sensation gives you shivers.
# When you break apart, you still feel warm from Tai's touch.
# His smile is wonderfully bright.

# tai "Before I came to the Villa, I wondered if I'd get bored. I should've known better."
# s3_mc "I can't picture you being bored."
# tai "I thought there might be loads of lying around doing nothing."
# tai "Don't get me wrong. I love sunbathing as much as the next guy."
# tai "But I didn't want to end up twiddling my thumbs, you know?"
# Choiceseb "Tai didn't want to get bored on Love Island..."
# -Could anyone get bored here?
# -I didn't want to get bored either
# s3_mc "I didn't really know what it would be like."
# s3_mc "You see it on TV, but that's not the same  as seeing it with your own eyes."
# s3_mc "I wondered if there'd be enough to do."
# s3_mc "But it ended up with even more than I could have hoped!"

# -I'd stop you getting bored
# s3_mc "Anytime you feel yourself getting bored, you can count on me."
# tai "I take it you don't mean for a game of Snap?"
# tai "Though I did play strip Snap once."
# s3_mc "How'd that go?"
# tai "I got very cold."
# tai "I'll definitely count on you if I'm at a loose end."
# tai "Or, y'know, anytime."

# tai "It's funny, normally I never stop moving. I think that's why I thought I might get bored."
# tai "But this is like a dream holiday."
# tai "If I was in London right now, it'd probably be raining."
# tai "What would you be up to if you weren't in the Villa?"
# Choiceseb "If I wasn't in the Villa, I'd be..."
# -Busy with work
# s3_mc "I'd probably have my nose to the grindstone."

# -Chilling with my friends
# s3_mc "Probably hanging out with my friends."
# s3_mc "Hopefully I wouldn't have my nose to the grindstone."

# -Watching Love Island
# s3_mc "As if I could be doing anything else!"
# s3_mc "I'd be parked on my sofa watching you on Love Island."
# tai "And I bet you'd fancy me."
# Choiceseb "Tai thinks I'd fancy him if I saw him on TV..."
# -I'd be jealous of whoever you were with
# tai "Aww, don't be jealous. I'd care about you, too."
# tai "Not that the other person would be real."
# tai "Anyway, I'm glad you'd be doing something fun with your summer."
# s3_mc "Yeah, hopefully I wouldn't have my nose to the grindstone."

# -Of course I would
# s3_mc "You're irresistible."
# tai "Right back at you. (you get 😍 with Tai)"
# tai "I'm glad you'd be doing something fun with your summer."
# s3_mc "Yeah, hopefully I wouldn't have my nose to the grindstone."

# -But I wouldn't know you
# s3_mc "You're fit."
# tai "Of course."
# tai "But I wouldn't know you the way I do now. It's not the same."
# For a couple of moments, Tai searches for the right word. (you get 😍 with Tai)
# tai "That's awesome."
# tai "Anyway, I'm glad you'd be doing something fun with your summer."
# s3_mc "Yeah, hopefully I wouldn't have my nose to the grindstone."

# tai "The what to the what-stone?"
# tai "I've never heard that before, say it again!"
# s3_mc "Nose to the grindstone!"
# s3_mc "It's when you're working really hard."
# tai "But where's the grindstone coming in?"
# tai "Maybe it's a stone you grind on, like a pole in a club."
# thought "Tai's thinking too much about this."
# Choiceseb "How shall I distract him?"
# -Tickle him
# -Give him a kiss
# MC. Hey, Tai. You're thinking too much.
# Tai returns his attention to you just in time for you to lean close and kiss him on the forehead.
# He laughs and strokes your hair back from your face.
# tai "You've got a point. (you get 😍 with Tai)"

# -Say 'grindstone' sexily
# s3_mc "Hey, Tai. Over here."
# Tai returns his attention to you, and you lean in very close to his ear.
# s3_mc "Grindstone."
# Tai shivers.
# tai "Told you. Anything you say, boom! It's hot."

# ciaran "Hey, MC?"
# s3_mc "Yeah?"
# ciaran "I was thinking where I want to take you when we're out of the Villa."
# ciaran "Like, on dates."
# ciaran "That's another thing I think about on long shifts. Potential date ideas for my perfect woman."
# Choiceseb "That's..."
# -Cheesy
# -Accurate
# -Cute
# s3_mc "You really are a sweetheart, aren't you?"
# Ciaran blushes and smiles.
# ciaran "I suppose."

# ciaran "Obviously I want to show you Waterford, but I also want to take you and Kerry to the beach."
# ciaran "Make a nice picnic, get one of those massive umbrellas."
# ciaran "Does that sound nice?"
# Choiceseb "Do I want to go to the beach with Ciaran?"
# -I don't like the beach
# -Sounds perfect
# ciaran "Oh, good."
# ciaran "We'll pencil it in, then."

# -As long as it's somewhere sunny
# s3_mc "I'm thinking the Med or the Caribbean."
# ciaran "Woah! Might be tricky with a dog and all, but I'm sure we can make it."

# s3_mc "So, you haven't asked me whether I still like you today."
# ciaran "Oh gosh, I forgot!"
# ciaran "Do you?! Please say yes."
# s3_mc "Yes!"
# s3_mc "It's nice. It's like you're starting to actually believe it now."
# ciaran "You're right. I didn't think about whether you'd want to come on the date with me. I just thought about where I'd want to take you."
# ciaran "Watch out, you're looking at the new and improved Ciaran!"
# ciaran "Any tips on how to use my new confidence? For good or evil?"
# Choiceseb "What do I want Ciaran to do with his confidence?"
# -Act cocky
# -Believe in your sauce
# s3_mc "Have more faith in your writing!"
# s3_mc "The world needs to hear about Captain Kerry and her adventures with the smoking hot Ciaran-man."
# ciaran "Aw, MC, that means so much to me."
# s3_mc "Besides, who else is going to fight evil for planet Earth?"
# ciaran "We must step up to the challenge!"

# -Graft on me
# s3_mc "Show me your grafting skills."
# ciaran "You already know I'm terrible at that."
# ciaran "New day, new you! C'mon, show me what you've got."
# ciaran "OK, er, let me think."
# His brow furrows. He appears deep in thought.
# ciaran "Oh, I've got something."
# He takes one of your hands in both of his.
# ciaran "MC, I honestly think, with all sincerity, you are the most beautiful woman I've ever seen."
# Your heart skips a beat.
# ciaran "How was that?"
# s3_mc "Uh... yeah, Ciaran, that was good."
# s3_mc "I'd say that's Ciaran-brand grafting."
# ciaran "Good!"

# ciaran "OK, I have a handle on it now, I think."
# ciaran "Ciaran-man is ready for action."
# ciaran "Anything else you want me to do?"
# Choiceseb "Shall I make Ciaran do anything else?"
# -Nah
# -Kiss me!
# s3_mc "I want to see you kiss me for a change."
# ciaran "That's something I can handle..."
# He moves closer to you, slowly, with a sly smile.
# Gently, he puts both hands on your waist, and moves his lips so they're inches from yours.
# He laughs and kisses you fiercely, his grip on your waist tightening. You run your hands into his hair and let him take control of the kiss.
# You are left breathless, staring at him as he grins mischievously.
# s3_mc "OK. You have to do that more often."
# ciaran "Agreed."

# ciaran "You know, MC, you make me feel so different."
# ciaran "It's a really good different."
# ciaran "I'm really glad I met you."
# s3_mc "I'm glad, too."

# yasmin "So... do you remember what I said, about how I never want to be in a long distance relationship?"
# s3_mc "Yeah?"
# She slowly strokes her thumb across the back of your hand.
# yasmin "I was just wondering how you feel about all that."
# yasmin "Have you ever tried it?"
# Choiceseb "Have I ever been in a long distance relationship?"
# -Yeah, it worked for me
# -Yes, but I didn't like it
# -Nope, I've never tried it
# yasmin "Do you think you ever would?"
# Choiceseb "Would I ever be in a long distance relationship?"
# -No, I wouldn't like it
# -Sure, I'd be open to it
# yasmin "Noted."

# -Only if it was with you
# yasmin "Aw, babe. (you get 😍 with Yasmin)"

# yasmin "I only ask because I was wondering..."
# yasmin "How you and I might potentially work outside the Villa. You know, if we decided that was going to be a thing."
# yasmin "We might leave here and suddenly find ourselves living in totally different parts of the world."
# Choiceseb "If me and Yasmin ended up living far apart..."
# -You'd have to move closer to me
# -We'd make it work long distance
# -I'd move to be closer to you
# s3_mc "Wherever you go, I can go too."
# yasmin "Babe... (you get 😍 with Yasmin)"
# yasmin "You don't know how much that means to me."

# yasmin "Your presence is intoxicating. The way you make me feel when you're here beside me..."
# yasmin "I don't want to lose that."
# yasmin "And if we lived apart, I wouldn't be able to do this..."
# She cups your face in her hands and smiles.
# Choiceseb "Yasmin's going in for a kiss"
# -Turn your face away

# -Keep it short and sweet
# You close your eyes as she presses a tender kiss to your mouth.
# You enjoy the feeling of her lips against yours for a moment, before pulling back.

# -Make it last
# You sink into a slow, deep kiss. (you get 😍 with Yasmin)
# Yasmin strokes your hair. Her hand travels the length of your neck before slipping lower, down your back.
# Finally, she rests her forehead against yours and gazes into your eyes.

# yasmin "Let's just say..."
# yasmin "There's a lot of things I'd miss if you were far away."

# s3_mc "Are we the only ones still in bed?"
# You hear a rustle of sheets.
# M/iona "Nope, you're not alone."
# Miki/Iona gets out of her bed and looks over briefly.
# Liona "Oops. Sorry, babe."
# LI whispers in your ear.
# Liona "I totally didn't notice that Miki/Iona was here."
# [he_she] bites [his_her] lip as [he_she] gets up from the bed.
# Liona "I'm going for a shower."
# LI whispers in your ear as [he_she] leans over the side of the bed to grab a towel.
# Liona "You can come and join me if you want."
# [he_she] gets up and goes to the bathroom, a towel over [his_her] shoulder.
# Choiceseb "Maybe I should follow LI for that sexy shower..."
# -Heck yeah I want to shower with LI (gem choice)
# -Nah, I'll just go and get changed
# thought "Yeah, I don't need a hot sexy steamy shower."
# You get out of bed and walk over the dressing room.
# thought "I'll just end up getting more dirty than I already am."
# Choiceseb "Maybe I should shower with LI..."
# -Let's get steamy with dreamy LI (gem choice)
# -Nah, I'll just go and get changed.
# You head over to the dressing room.

# Gem choice:
# You leap out of the bed and rush over to the bathroom.
# s3_mc "Let me get my steam on..."
# thought "I was so excited I forgot my towel!"
# Miki/Iona laughs.
# M/iona "Oh, MC..."
# You grab a towel and head out to the bathroom.

# LI is already in the shower. A pile of [his_her] clothes are on the side.
# The steam from the hot water rises around [his_her] body.
# Liona "Is that you, MC?"
# s3_mc "Sure is, babe."
# Liona "Come on in."
# You slip out of your clothes and get into the shower.
# Ciaran/Tai/Camilo/AJ turns around stroking a large pile of white foamy soap in [his_her] arms.
# C/T/Cam/aj "I've been expecting you."
# s3_mc "I thought evil villains wore a grey smock, not..."
# You look Ciaran/Tai/Camilo/AJ up and down.
# s3_mc "Absolutely nothing."
# Ciaran/Tai/Camilo/AJ winks and whispers.
# C/T/Cam/aj "I'm wearing an invisible cloak."
# s3_mc "I can see that."
# [he_she] laughs and splashes you gently with foam.
# Liona "Thanks for joining me, babe."
# s3_mc "No sweat."
# [he_she] starts to wash [his_her] body with soap.
# s3_mc "Literally."
# Choiceseb "I should..."
# -Help LI wash himself/herself
# You put some soap in your hand and give LI a back massage.
# Liona "Oh, that feels well nice. (you get 😏 with LI)"
# Liona "You're good with your hands."

# -Make loads of soapy bubbles
# You squeeze a bit of soap in your palms, cup your hands, and blow.
# Large iridescent bubbles float around you both.
# LI jumps up to catch one of the bubbles in [his_her] hand.
# s3_mc "Beautiful, huh?"
# Liona "Yeah."

# -Give LI a funny hair style (AJ+Yasmin missing)
# You put some soap in your hands and rub it into LI's hair.
# His shoulders visibly relax. (you get 😂 with Tai)
# tai "I actually love my hair being played with."
# You fashion his hair into a spikey mess.(Bill/Harry/Tai/Camilo/Ciaran)
# Tai/Camilo grins at you while putting soap in your hair and giving you the same spiked up look.
# T/camilo "Perfection."
# B/H/ciaran "Not going to lie, back in the day that's what my hair used to look like."
# You both fall about laughing and rinse away your masterpiece. (you get 😂 with LI)

# The warm water rolls off LI's body.
# [he_she] looks hotter than ever.
# Liona "You know what the best thing about having a shower together is?"
# Choiceseb "What's the best thing about having a shower with LI?"
# -I really needed a shower
# -We can get some sexy alone time
# Liona "Wow, I was thinking it was good for the environment."
# Liona "Also it's always what they do in spy movies so, like, we can be sure."
# Liona "But I like your answer too."

# -It's good for environment
# Liona "Ding, ding, ding."
# Liona "We have a winner."
# LI winks.
# Liona "It feels good to get hot and heavy for the sake of the planet."

# You both rinse the shampoo off your hair, taking it in turns to get the best angle under the powerful shower.
# s3_mc "It sure is steamy in here."
# Liona "Yeah..."
# Ciaran/Tai blushes a little.
# B/H/Cam/Y/aj "Maybe we can make it a little more steamy..."
# Choiceseb "I should..."
# -Splash [him_her]
# You flick water at LI.
# Liona "Is that, like, a sexy move or something?"
# s3_mc "No, I'm just splashing you."
# Liona "Oh! My bad."
# LI quickly splashes you back.

# -Kiss [him_her]
# You lean in to LI and kiss [his_her] lips.
# [he_she] pulls you in closer so your wet bodies are almost touching.

# [he_she] turns around and lets the water spray into [his_her] face.
# The water trickles down the nape of [his_her] neck.
# It's just you and LI.
# Liona "We don't get many alone moments in that bedroom, do we?"
# s3_mc "Nope, not really."
# Choiceseb "This could be a perfect opportunity to..."
# -Just splash about
# Liona "Sure, we can splash about if you want!"
# LI cups the head of the shower with [his_her] hands and then pours water all over you.

# -Do some sexy shower bits
# You grin at [him_her] cheekily.
# s3_mc "Shall we make the most of this private time?"
# He nods, hurriedly, blushing a little.
# ciaran "Hell, yeah!"
# You step closer to his body.
# B/H/T/Cam/Y/aj "You took the words right out of my head."
# [he_she] pulls you closer towards [his_her] body.
# In a flurry of passion, you gently but firmly press LI against the tilted wall.
# C/aj "That's cold."
# s3_mc "Oops."
# LI breathes heavily as you explore each other's naked wet bodies.
# Liona "I've never done it in the shower before."
# s3_mc "Has anyone ever told you that you're, like, a work of art?"
# Liona "No, they haven't!"
# s3_mc "Well, I want to pin you up against the wall."
# s3_mc "Like the masterpiece you are."
# Liona "Oh, MC..."
# LI kisses you, desperate for you.
# C/T/Cam/aj "Frame me."
# B/H/yasmin "Enough with the smooth lines."
# LI kisses your lips and whispers in your ear.
# Liona "I want you."
# [his_her] body is wet to your touch.
# Liona "I need you."
# You kiss [his_her] neck, while your fingertips travel down [his_her] body.
# Liona "Oh, wow."
# LI shudders beneath your touch.
# As [he_she] desperately pulls you close, you feel your breath catch.
# Hot water trails down your body, along with LI's hands.
# Surging heat builds between you. Eventually, you're both satisfied.
# As you slowly pull away from each other, LI breathes out heavily.
# Liona "Hot damn."
# Liona "That was amazing."

# Suddenly there is a knock at the door.
# M/iona "Hello?"
# M/iona "Are you guys, like, OK in there?"
# Liona "Um, sorry Miki/Iona! Just a second."
# LI and you laugh.
# s3_mc "Busted."
# M/iona "Come on, I really need the loo."
# Liona "We'd better get out."
# LI steps out and wraps a towel around himself/herself.
# As you get out, [he_she] wraps one around you.
# Liona "There."
# Liona "Nice and clean now."
# s3_mc "Sort of."
# LI winks at you.
# You head over to the dressing room to get changed.

# thought "Hmm..."
# thought "I don't know what today will bring at all."
# thought "I better go out with a fierce look so I'm ready for anything and everything."
# Outfit change to swimwear
# thought "Oh, I love this thing."
# thought "Oh this is the real deal."
# thought "I look great!"
# You shrug.
# thought "This will have to do, I suppose."
# (not choosing the gem choice to join LI in the shower):
# LI walks in, towel drying [his_her] hair.
# s3_mc "Nice shower?"
# Liona "It would have been better with you in it."
# (choosing the gem choice to join LI in the shower):
# Liona "Clean now, babe?"
# LI winks at you, towel drying [his_her] hair.
# s3_mc "Totally."
# Liona "I love it when you wear that, by the way."
# s3_mc "What, this old thing?"
# Liona "Yeah, it's gorgeous."
# Liona "You look gorgeous in that, by the way. (you get 🤩 with LI)"
# s3_mc "Aw, thanks hun!"
# Liona "You look great in anything, obviously. But you'd look even in better in nothing, I think."
# Your stomach rumbles.
# Liona "Hungry?"
# s3_mc "Starving."
# Liona "You go get yourself something to eat while I sort myself out."
# s3_mc "Oh, OK. Sure."
# You head downstairs to the kitchen for breakfast.

# You walk down into the kitchen. BFF is making breakfast.
# bff "Cup of something, MC?"
# Choiceseb "I want a cup of..."
# -Tea
# bff "One tea coming up."

# -Coffee
# bff "One coffee coming up."

# -Wheatgrass smoothie
# bff "A what?"
# s3_mc "A wheatgrass smoothie."
# s3_mc "Don't you know what a wheatgrass smoothie is?"
# s3_mc "They were all the rage last summer."
# bff "Really? OK, I'll see if we have any."
# BFF crouches down and searches through a cupboard, confusion still etched around her/his face.
# bff "Hmm, I don't think we have that here."

# Ciaran comes over clutching a mug.
# Ciaran blushes when he sees you.
# ciaran "Hey again."
# s3_mc "Hey."
# ciaran "Can I get some of that water once it's boiled, please?"
# bff "Sure. What are you after?"
# ciaran "Cuppa tea, please."
# bff "I'll bring it over to you."
# Ciaran smiles.
# ciaran "Grand."
# BFF puts the kettle on to boil.

# elladine "So, babes. What's your got-to breakfast?"
# Choiceseb "Elladine wants to know my go-to breakfast..."
# -Cereal. All day, every day
# -I like a continental breakfast
# -Most days I just have a quick snack
# -It's a fry-up, obvs
# elladine "Knew, you were my friend for a reason."
# elladine "Can't be dealing with anyone who badmouths a full English."
# elladine "And I make the best one around."
# elladine "Important questions time. Do you have the black pudding?"
# Choiceseb "Do I take pudding with my fry-ups? (no further reactions)"
# -Obviously
# -Never
# -Only when I'm feeling adventurous 
# elladine "Sound. And your opinion on hash browns?"
# Choiceseb "Hash browns in a fry-up?"
# -Hate 'em
# -Love 'em, but not in a fry up
# -Love 'em
# elladine "Correct choice."

# elladine "Alright, what about a drink? Orange juice, tea, or something else?"
# Choiceseb "What drink do I have with my fry-up?"
# -Milk
# elladine "Not a bad choice."
# elladine "But it's not as good as tea. It's the best thing for early mornings."

# -Tea
# elladine "Ding ding!"
# elladine "Not sure how anyone can drink anything else, to be honest."

# -Orange juice 
# elladine "Not a bad choice."
# elladine "But it's not as good as tea. It's the best thing for early mornings."

# elladine "Maybe it's just in my blood? I like to joke about that sometimes..."
# elladine "What thing do Brits and Iranians have most in common?"
# s3_mc "I don't know, what?"
# elladine "They both love tea way too much."
# s3_mc "I neve realised you had such strong opinions on fry-ups."
# elladine "Yeah, I sound like Bill, now, don't I?"

# elladine "Alright, since I'm here grilling you already about your morning routine, how about another question?"
# s3_mc "Go for it."
# s3_mc "Morning sex?"
# s3_mc "Woah. That took a turn."
# elladine "Sorry. Guess I have sausage on my brain."
# s3_mc "Was that even a question?"
# elladine "I mean, what do you think of it?"
# elladine "When you've literally just woken up. Is it fun? Or just good in theory?"
# s3_mc "You've never done it?"
# elladine "Um, no. I just sort of figured... well, there's all that bad breath, and you're all sweaty from the night..."
# elladine "At least I usually am. First thing I have to do in the morning is shower."
# elladine "I can't do anything else until then."
# elladine "So... is it good?"
# elladine "Nicky mentioned it, you see, so..."
# Choiceseb "What do I think of morning sex?"
# -You're right, it's just icky
# -I've never really done it either
# s3_mc "Sorry I can't help you! I'd not really thought about it until now, but I guess I'm just as new to it as you."
# s3_mc "Guess the only way for us to find out is to try!"
# elladine "Guess you're right."
# elladine "I'll, uh..."
# elladine "...I'll float the idea by him, I suppose."

# -I love it
# s3_mc "Honestly, babe. If Nicky wants to do it, and you're feeling adventurous, go for it."
# s3_mc "There's something so primal and basic about it."
# s3_mc "And what's hotter than someone waking up and their first thought being what they could do with you."
# elladine "Yeah... when you put it like that. (you get 😳 with Elladine)"
# elladine "I think, well, I'll talk to Nicky about it."

# elladine "Thanks, hun."
# s3_mc "No problem!"
# The kettle clicks as it finishes boiling. Elladine pours you a cup of tea.
# elladine "OK, one more?"
# s3_mc "Sure."
# elladine "Early bird or night owl?"
# s3_mc "Ooh, good one!"
# Choiceseb "Am I an early bird or night owl?"
# -Early bird
# s3_mc "Gotta seize the day, early bird catches the worm, and all that jazz."
# elladine "And there's more than a few worms to catch in the Villa, right?"
# s3_mc "Elladine!"
# elladine "What? It's true isn't it?"
# elladine "Anyway I'm the same."

# -Night owl
# elladine "Ah. I always think there's something romantic about that."
# elladine "Like, in movies the night owls are all those tortured creative souls who can only work by the moonlight."
# elladine "As cool as that sounds, I can't hack it."

# elladine "I have to be in bed early or I start falling asleep."
# elladine "My friends used to always joke about me falling asleep on the dance floor."
# elladine "I just get lost in the music sometimes!"
# s3_mc "Just 'resting your eyes', right?"
# elladine "Exactly."

# genevieve "You know, I think things are going to be different with Seb."
# genevieve "Compared to my past relationships, that is."
# s3_mc "How so?"
# genevieve "I'm going to explain it in kind of a weird way, but stick with me..."
# genevieve "So, I read this book called 'Creating Your Feminine Breeze'. It's about how women are always the caregivers and men try to take advantage of that."
# genevieve "Basically women are goddesses, and men are mortals trying to suck out our power for their own gain."
# genevieve "Does that make sense?"
# Choiceseb "Do I understand what Viv is saying?"
# -No
# s3_mc "They're trying to suck what out of us?!"
# genevieve "No! Not physically. Emotionally."

# -Yes
# s3_mc "Goddesses are naturally generous, and it intimidates mortals."
# genevieve "Exactly!"

# -I've read that book too!
# s3_mc "It changed my life."
# s3_mc "Goddesses are naturally generous, and it intimidates mortals."
# genevieve "Exactly!"

# genevieve "It's like, I went out with a guy who told me he was going to be an entrepreneur."
# genevieve "It impressed me at first, but then I found out that 'being an entrepreneur' largely involved him playing Duty Calls."
# genevieve "I paid that guy's rent for almost a year. Plus every bill when we went out for dinner so he wouldn't have to wash dishes."
# genevieve "All while getting my PhD."
# genevieve "I dumped him eventually, but not soon enough."
# genevieve "And that book helped me realise that if a mortal wants to be with a goddess, he has to help her shine."
# s3_mc "Seb's definitely that guy."
# genevieve "I think so too."
# genevieve "I'm not too proud to admit I've been taken advantage of before."
# Choiceseb "Viv's been taken advantage of..."
# -That's horrible
# genevieve "Yeah, it is."

# -It's cos you're so caring
# genevieve "Aw, that's nice of you to say."
# genevieve "You're probably right. Not a lot of people would pay someone else's rent, but  I suppose he targeted me cos he knew I would."

# -Me too
# genevieve "Babe, I'm sorry."
# s3_mc "Thanks."

# She holds up her fist and bumps yours.
# genevieve "To new beginnings!"

# nicky "Here's something."
# nicky "I might have a proposal for Seb. But I wanna get your take on it before I ask him."
# Choiceseb "A 'proposal' for Seb?"
# -You're going to rob a bank together?
# nicky "Hmm. Someday, maybe."
# s3_mc "Do you think he'd be any good?"
# nicky "You never know.I think he'd be good at moving silently, so maybe he can be the one who does the actual stealing."
# nicky "I'm the ringleader and the planner, obviously."
# nicky "And you can be the one who distracts the guards with your womanly charm."

# -You're going to ask him to marry you?
# nicky " Ha, not yet. He doesn't seem like the marrying sort."
# s3_mc "No offence, but I don't think you're his type, either."
# nicky "Tragic but true."
# nicky "Well, you never know. Maybe someday he'll get married in a graveyard or something and live gloomily ever after."
# nicky "He could have a bat for the officiant."

# -You're going to buy out his shop?
# nicky "God, no. Can you imagine?"
# nicky "I'd have to shut it down and turn it into a shoe shop or something."
# nicky "I don't understand how he stays in business. Who's buying records anymore? And from Seb, of all people?"
# nicky "Can you imagine his customer service? How does he do it?"
# s3_mc "I think he said the shop has a little café as part of it, so it's not just records."
# s3_mc "But I know what you mean."

# s3_mc "What does this have to do with your proposal?"
# nicky "Oh, right, yeah. The thing."
# nicky "I was thinking about asking Seb to do a podcast with me, once all this is over."
# nicky "'Cause he actually really knows his stuff when it comes to music, and obviously I take an interest, 'cause it's my job."
# nicky "And we could talk about our favourite artists, do reviews, that kind of thing."
# nicky "What d'you think? Would anybody listen to that?"
# Choiceseb "Nicky wants to ask Seb to host a podcast with him..."
# -He'll never agree to that
# -Yeah, that's a great idea!
# s3_mc "You guys are both smart, and you're funny together, too. I think it'll be a great combination."
# nicky "Cheers! I'm really glad you think so."

# -If you're sure he's up to it...
# s3_mc "Talking to people isn't exactly Seb's favourite thing in the world."
# s3_mc "I know he's come out of his shell a bit since we've been here, but it's still a big ask."
# nicky "True, but don't forget, he did apply to come on Love Island. And he's done well so far."
# nicky "After this, I reckon a little podcast will be no trouble."

# nicky "To be honest, and don't tell him this..."
# nicky "....Part of the reason I want to ask him is so we have an excuse to stay in touch after Love Island."
# nicky "I don't want him to just retreat into this cave when it ends and none of us ever see him again, y'know?"
# Choiceseb "Nicky's doing this as an excuse to stay friends with Seb..."
# -That's silly, you should just tell him you want to hang out
# -Aw, that's actually pretty cute
# s3_mc "I won't tell him. I think it might be too much sweetness for him to handle all at once."
# nicky "Yeah, that's my thinking."
# nicky "Friendship is still new to him. He just needs time to get used to it."

# -Then why aren't you asking me to host a podcast with you?
# nicky "'Cause you're not like Seb. I don't need to trick you into hanging out with me."
# s3_mc "Well, maybe, but you should at least be trying!"

# Nicky grins.

# seb "Hey, MC. Have you ever made a mixtape for someone you fancied?"
# s3_mc "A 'mixtape'?"
# seb "You know what I mean. A playlist."
# Choiceseb "Have I ever made a playlist for someone I fancied?"
# -Come on, I'm not that melty
# -Yeah, it's a great way to flirt
# s3_mc "I love it. So romantic."
# seb "Yes! Me too."

# -No, but it's a cute idea
# s3_mc "I think I'd just melt if someone did that for me."
# seb "Oh, good. I wasn't sure if any girls actually liked it."
# s3_mc "Tried it before, have you?"
# seb "Only a lot."
# s3_mc "Does it work?"
# seb "...Sometimes."

# seb "It's like a reflex. When I really like a girl, I just have to start making a playlist for her."
# seb "With all the songs we've talked about together, or songs I think she'll like, or songs that remind me of her."
# seb "I'm thinking about making one for Viv."
# seb "Obvs. I have to do it in my head until I get home."
# seb "And I know it's too soon! I know that. But I can't help it."
# seb "I can't stop thinking of things I could do to try and make her smile."
# seb "Her smile is just... mate, it goes right through me."
# Choiceseb "Seb's going on about Viv..."
# -You two are adorable
# s3_mc "You make such a cute couple."
# seb "We're not... I mean, we're not a proper couple. Like, officially."
# seb "I think."

# -Come on, give it a rest
# s3_mc "Dude, I don't want this friendship to turn into you banging on about how great your girlfriend is."
# seb "She's not my girlfriend!"

# -Have you told her this?
# seb "Told her what?"
# s3_mc "Uh, that you're in love with her?"
# seb "What? No I'm not!"

# s3_mc "Well, it seems like you're already halfway there, at least."
# s3_mc "Just a few days ago you told me you 'never fall for girls like her'."
# s3_mc "And now you're talking about her like you've fallen head over heels."
# seb "You're right. I mean, I always wished I could be with a girl like that."
# seb "And now I think I've finally done it."
# seb "I've fallen for someone nice who actually likes me back."
# Choiceseb "Seb's feeling good about falling for Genevieve..."
# -Alright, now just try not to mess it up
# -I'm really happy for you
# s3_mc "I think you're gonna be good for each other."
# seb "Thanks, mate."

# -I wouldn't get too excited yet
# s3_mc "Look, I know being happy is still new and exciting for you, but don't get carried away."
# s3_mc "You haven't actually known each other that long. You don't know how things will be outside the Villa."
# seb "You're right. I'll try to keep my feet on the ground."

# seb "I'm finally starting to feel like I do belong here after all."
# seb "Actually, I think that chat we had the other day really helped."
# seb "It turns out nice things happen sometimes when you're not always on the lookout for the next disaster."
# s3_mc "Who knew?"
# Seb grins.

# bff "So, how are you feeling about last night?"
# Choiceseb "How do I feel about getting with LI?"
# -LI is punching up, to be honest

# -I couldn't be happier
# BFF smiles. 
# bff "You two look great together."
# genevieve "Oh, and MC, I really wanted to say that I'm happy for you and Harry."
# genevieve "So don't worry about me."
# genevieve "In case you were."
# Genevieve smiles at you.
# genevieve "And I'm actually kind of excited to see where this whole thing with Seb goes."
# bff "I'm so, like, happy for you both. (doesn't appear if Genevieve is BFF and MC is coupled with Harry)"

# -It was fate, nothing could stop us
# bff "Ha, yeah, I guess you're right!"
# genevieve "Oh, and MC, I really wanted to say that I'm happy for you and Harry."
# genevieve "So don't worry about me."
# genevieve "In case you were."
# Genevieve smiles at you.
# genevieve "And I'm actually kind of excited to see where this whole thing with Seb goes."
# bff "I'm so, like, happy for you both. (doesn't appear if Genevieve is BFF and MC is coupled with Harry)"

# bff "Your speech was amazing, by the way."
# Choiceseb "BFF liked my recoupling speech."
# -Yay! I worked really hard on it
# bff "You could tell!"

# -Really? It was totally improvised
# G/elladine "Sometimes improvisation gives us the most genuine words."
# N/seb "That's well brave. I couldn't have done that."

# -Thanks, it came from the bottom of my heart
# BFF starts to sniff the air.
# bff "Can you smell that?"
# [he_she] sniffs your shoulder.
# bff "Smells like cheese."
# s3_mc "Very funny."
# bff "I'm kidding. You're both class."

# The kettle stops boiling.
# bff "So..."
# BFF pours out the water into some mugs.
# s3_mc "So?"
# bff "It seems like things are all good for you two."
# bff "Yeah, from everything you've said, you seem really smitten. (if you chose “fate” and “bottom of my heart”)"
# Genevieve pours out the hot water.
# (if you took a shower with LI and did bits): 
# G/elladine "Did I hear that mouse in the bathroom earlier?"
# s3_mc "Um..."
# G/elladine "I definitely heard some squeaking."
# s3_mc "No, I didn't see any mice."
# G/elladine "Huh, I thought I could hear it when you and LI were in the bathroom."
# G/elladine "I must have pool water in my ear or something."
# S/nicky "And it certainly sounded like you two were having fun in the shower."
# s3_mc "You heard us?"
# S/nicky "I know a sexy noise when I hear one."
# You blush.
# bff "But, like, between you and me..."
# bff "Do you think you'll be loyal with LI for, like, the rest of the time in the Villa?"
# Choiceseb "Will I be loyal with LI?"
# -Yeah, I want to be loyal
# bff "That's cool."
# bff "But seriously."

# -My head could turn
# bff "Really?"
# s3_mc "You never know what will happen in this place."
# BFF sighs.
# bff "Yeah, I guess you're right."

# -We will rule the land together forever
# bff "I meant loyal, not royal."
# s3_mc "I know."
# s3_mc "And we will reign as the best, most royally loyal couple ever."
# BFF laughs, spitting out her/his tea a little.
# bff "You're so funny."
# bff "But seriously."

# bff "Have you had a chat with LI about, like, loyalty and stuff?"
# s3_mc "Nope, not exactly..."
# bff "Hmm..."
# bff "Do you think he's/she's a loyal person?"
# Choiceseb "Do I think LI is loyal?"
# -Yeah, I think we're pretty solid
# bff "Well, that's good."
# bff "I don't want you to worry or anything."

# -He's/She's [his_her] own person, I'm not forcing anything
# bff "That's a good headspace to be in."
# bff "I don't want you to worry or anything."

# -If [he_she] knows what's good for [him_her] then [he_she] will be
# bff "Don't you think that's, like, a bit threatening?"
# You sigh.
# s3_mc "I guess..."
# bff "You don't want to come across, like, possessive."
# bff "I don't want you to worry or anything."

# BFF grabs a spoon from the drawer and starts to stir the tea.
# bff "But it's good to keep an eye on these things."
# The sound of the teaspoon hitting the china rings across the kitchen.
# s3_mc "Um, BFF..."
# s3_mc "What are you saying?"
# bff "I'm not insinuating anything, MC."
# s3_mc "Has [he_she] said something about me to you?"
# bff "I'm just thinking out loud."
# bff "Ignore me, MC."
# BFF picks up the mugs.
# bff "I'm sure it'll be fine."
# bff "Ah, phew, it's Ciaran."
# BFF glances at you, looking a little flustered.
# bff "Tea's ready."
# ciaran "Ta, BFF."
# He blows on it and then takes an indulgent sip.
# ciaran "That's cracking, cheers."
# Some other Islanders saunter into the kitchen.
# thought "What if LI isn't as loyal as I thought?"
# LI heads over to the fridge.
# thought "Could BFF be right?"
# Liona "I am in such a snacking mood today."
# thought "I guess that's [his_her] priority right now."
# thought "Food."
# (if you took a shower with Harry/Camilo/Tai and did bits and Seb/Nicky is BFF):
# S/nicky "Did you hear a mouse earlier, Harry/Camilo/Tai? I could hear, like, weird noises coming from the bathroom earlier."
# H/Cam/tai "From the bathroom?"
# Harry/Camilo/Tai laughs.
# H/Cam/tai "Oh, we were just cleaning the tiles, like, really hard."
# S/nicky "Aw, that's nice of you."
# M/iona "What's going on in here?"
# yasmin "It's snack time."
# yasmin "And MC as usual is looking like a snack."
# s3_mc "Cheers, Yasmin."
# genevieve "But it's still, like, the morning, isn't it?"
# M/iona "I feel like it's basically brunch now."
# Elladine claps her hands enthusiastically.
# elladine "Oh, I am so going to have a good brunch."
# M/iona "It's a marketing tactic, babe."
# M/iona "Don't fall for it."
# ciaran "What on earth is brunch?"
# tai "How can you not know what brunch is, Ciaran?"
# Choiceseb "Ciaran asked what brunch is... (no further reactions)"
# -It's a late morning meal
# -It's a ploy to make you spend more money
# -It's when you have a brilliant hunch about something

# tai "I'll make you the best brunch of your life, Ciaran."
# tai "You just wait and see."
# tai "I am a master brunch-maker."
# B/camilo "BBQ king and brunch expert..."
# B/camilo "Is there no limit to your skills?"
# Tai crouches down and starts to rummage in a cupboard.
# tai "Nope."
# tai "It's all about the presentation, young bruncher."
# ciaran "Oh, really?"
# tai "It sure is."
# (MC coupled with Yasmin/AJ):
# He brings out a bag of baps and piles them on the counter.
# tai "Baps?"
# Ciaran smiles.
# ciaran "I love them."
# tai "I know."
# tai "Prepare for the best bap of your life!"
# tai "I need avocados."
# He gets out a couple of avocados from the fridge.
# ciaran "So what's the secret?"
# tai "As long as it looks good you can't go wrong."
# Tai mushes up some avocado with raw egg.
# B/camilo "You're meant to at least boil the egg first, Tai."
# bill "Raw egg is, like, worse than celery."
# bill "Did you know that an uncooked egg doesn't give you, like, barely any of the protein a cooked one would?"
# camilo "I'm all for experimenting in the kitchen, but this is, like, actually dangerous."
# tai "Nonsense."
# Tai continues to mash the sticky green mixture.
# He packs it into some baps and garnishes it with a leaf of basil.
# B/camilo "Looks like the boogey monster sneezed on the baps."
# tai "Nah, mate. You wouldn't know good food if it ate you."
# Bill/Camilo sighs.
# B/camilo "I'm not even going to dignify that with a response."
# M/iona "Yeah, sorry hun, that's inedible."
# M/iona "You can't really eat raw eggs."
# Choiceseb "Raw egg and avocado in a bap..."
# -You've ruined a good bap
# tai "I didn't mean to... (you get 🙁 with Tai)"

# -I wouldn't eat that even if you paid me
# tai "Oh... (you get 🙁 with Tai)"

# -Sounds like a good hair mousse
# M/iona "That's actually a really good shout."
# Tai sighs.
# tai "Yeah..."
# He pokes at the bap. Green stuff oozes out.

# tai "Think I got a bit carried away.(MC not coupled with Yasmin/AJ)"
# Tai dejectedly scrapes the bap into the bin.(MC not coupled with Yasmin/AJ)
# (MC coupled with Yasmin/AJ):
# tai "Think I got a bit carried away."
# tai "Sorry Ciaran..."
# ciaran "It's the thought that counts. Don't worry about it."
# ciaran "We can get brunch in my hometown together when we get out if you'd like."
# Tai smiles, scraping the bap in the bin.
# tai "Yeah, I'd like that."
# Liona "I'm still hungry though..."
# A text rings out.
# bff "Oh."
# bff "Hold that bap."
# bff "I got a text!"
# Everyone crowds around BFF's screen.
# text "Islanders, put your best foot forward because two new Islanders will be arriving sometime today. #twosaparty #thirteenisacrowd"
# Liona "Ooh, new people!"
# Liona "Exciting..."
# bff "New Islanders?"
# BFF looks at you in shock.
# Choiceseb "New Islanders are coming into the Villa!"
# -Yay! That means more friends
# thought "It's always great to meet new people!"
# thought "I wonder if LI will just see them like a friend though..."

# -I hope LI's head doesn't turn...
# thought "I'd hate to lose [him_her] now!"

# -I hope they sweep me off my feet
# thought "LI is old news."
# thought "I'm ready to be, like, properly swept off my feet."
# You glance over at LI.
# He's/She's smiling at you, unaware of your thoughts.

# B/camilo "I wonder how they're going to arrive."
# genevieve "Giant suitcase?"
# elladine "Forget how."
# elladine "When are they going to arrive?"
# elladine "And who are they going to break up?"

# "Ah, Elladine."
# "You know what they say?"
# "The more..."
# "The merrier."
# "Or maybe it should be messier."
# "Can someone please get the Islanders to clean up that dressing room?"
# "I can see a mug that is wearing a green fuzzy jacket."
# "Not that my shed is any better..."
# "It gets pretty damp in here."
# "Coming up..."
# "Two new Islanders are on the way into the Villa."
# aj "This is the whole point of being here, to meet new people!"
# "And it gets hard finding space to fit them all in!"
# harry "What if the only space available is a cupboard?"
# "My hut is strictly off limits until I sort out this damp problem."

# "Welcome back to Love Island!"
# "It's a beautiful day in the Villa..."
# "For now."
# "This morning, the Island was wracked with terrible news..."
# bff "New Islanders?!"
# "I think the Islanders are becoming spoiled."
# "If they told me I'd have two sexy singles showing up at my doorstep, I'd show a little gratitude!"
# "This afternoon, the Islanders get up to some hijinks..."
# tai "I think we should play Hide and Seek!"
# "And MC makes a startling discovery..."
# s3_mc "There's someone in the wardrobe..."
# "Let's crack on."

# You and the other Islanders are slumped on the loungers.
# Everyone is stunned after this morning's text.
# elladine "That stinks. We had five seconds of peace, and now we've got new Islanders changing it up?"
# nicky "The course of true love never did run smooth."
# nicky "And the course of Love Island is like sandpaper."
# aj "Come on, guys! You don't think it's exciting?"
# aj "This is the whole point of being here, to meet new people!"
# yasmin "You're not worried about them grafting on MC?"
# AJ rolls her eyes.
# aj "No, I'm not. That's not my style."
# tai "AJ's right. What's the use in worrying about something you can't control?"
# Ciaran starts to list things off on his fingers.
# ciaran "You're more prepared, you've explored the possible options, maybe made a plan..."
# elladine "You're more likely to have anticipated outcomes."
# ciaran "Good one."
# tai "Agh! Stop!"
# Tai takes Ciaran's hand and kisses it. (MC coupled with AJ/Yasmin)
# Tai clampers his hand over Ciaran's mouth. (MC not coupled with AJ/Yasmin)
# tai "You're starting to make me nervous!"
# tai "MC, back me up, here."
# Choiceseb "Should you worry about things you can't control?"
# -Yes! The world is scary
# s3_mc "You have to think of every possibility..."
# s3_mc "Especially if you're having a difficult conversation. I play the whole thing in my head first."
# elladine "Right? I like to have some speech prepared! (you get 😍 with Elladine)"

# -No, it doesn't do any good
# s3_mc "Worrying won't change the outcome, except you'll feel worse at the end of it."
# tai "Yes! Thanks, MC. I knew you'd have my back. (you get 😍 with Tai)"
# elladine "I dunno. It's just a worrying situation... (you get 🙁 with Elladine)"

# -It depends on the situation
# s3_mc "If it's something like this, worrying won't help."
# s3_mc "But if it's like a test, worrying will motivate you to study, which will help."
# elladine "That's how I got through my apprenticeship. You can't hold molten glass without worrying about it. (you get 😍 with Elladine)"

# tai "I think we should distract ourselves."
# nicky "Oh, did you want me to hook up a games console?"
# iona "Wait, do we have one of those?"
# bill "Do we have one of those?"
# bill "Does it have Duty Calls?"
# nicky "That was sarcasm, Bill/Iona."
# iona "I knew that..."
# bill "Don't mess with a man's emotions like that, Nicky."
# tai "I was thinking something more physical."
# iona "I like where this is going..."
# tai "You've got the right idea, babe."
# s3_mc "Now that sounds like fun! (appears only if Iona is dumped)"
# tai "Mind out of the gutter, you."
# aj "Let's wrestle!"
# Liona "Dibs on MC!"
# tai "Wrestling is purely for conflict, and when you have too much mud."
# tai "I think we should play Hide and Seek!"
# harry "Are we children?"
# harry "Don't answer that."
# tai "It'll be fun! Don't pretend you're not excited."
# B/camilo "It'd be better than sitting here all day."
# AJ springs to her feet.
# aj "I think it's a great idea!"
# aj "Everyone has to play. It's my birthday, and I order it."
# nicky "By the birthday decree, it must be done."
# AJ tries to pull you to your feet.
# Choiceseb "AJ is trying to pull me up..."
# -Sweep her off her feet with a kiss
# You pull AJ onto your lap. She lets out a yelp.
# aj "MC..."
# You kiss her passionately, hearing groans from the other Islanders.
# She smiles into the kiss, her hands deep in your hair.
# nicky "Get a room!"
# You part, grinning at the other Islanders' sour expression.
# aj "Well, MC is in."

# -Go limp
# You let your muscles go limp as AJ tries to pull you off of the lounger.
# aj "MC!"
# s3_mc "What?"
# aj "You're not helping!"
# s3_mc "That is correct."
# She rolls her eyes.
# aj "Right. You're getting up."
# She squats down, slides her arms under you, braces herself, and lifts you off the lounger and into her arms.
# s3_mc "Oh my god, AJ!"
# aj "Leave no woman behind!"

# -Jump up
# You let AJ pull you to your feet.
# aj "Hey! There we go! We have our participant."

# -Belly roll away
# As she reaches for you, you let go of her hand, and let yourself roll sideways off the lounger.
# aj "MC!"
# You continue rolling away from the loungers.
# aj "Someone catch her! She's about to..."
# You fall into the pool.
# The others laugh as you climb back out.
# aj "That's karma for you."
# aj "At least you're up now."

# tai "Who else is playing?"
# Seb raises his hand. Everyone looks at him.
# seb "What?"
# seb "I think it could be fun."
# genevieve "Then I'm in too."
# Everyone else reluctantly raises their hands.
# yasmin "If nothing else, it'll give me an excuse to lie down somewhere."
# harry "What if the only hiding space left is somewhere tiny? Like, a cupboard?"
# yasmin "I'll lie diagonally to maximise space."
# harry "Smart. Efficient."
# Tai claps his hands and everyone turns to face him.
# tai "Right! We're playing classic rules here, no mods."
# tai "Whoever's 'it' counts to 100. Everyone else hides. If you get caught, you head back to the lawn."
# seb "Who's 'it'?"
# Liona "Me and MC can do it!"
# genevieve "Great!"
# Choiceseb "Li volunteered us to be 'it'..."
# -Roll your eyes
# s3_mc "Babe, you're meant to ask me before you volunteer me for stuff."
# Liona "Oh, right. Sorry. (you get 🙁 with LI)"
# Liona "Just, we can cover more ground with the both of us!"

# -Thanks for asking
# s3_mc "Babe, you're meant to ask me before you volunteer me for stuff."
# Liona "Oh, right. Sorry. (you get 🙁 with LI)"
# Liona "Just, we can cover more ground with the both of us!"

# -Yay! I'm excited
# s3_mc "This is gonna be fun!"
# Liona "Yeah, babe! We can cover more ground with the two of us. (you get 😍 with LI)"

# M/iona "Tactics. I like it."
# elladine "That's settled then. LI and MC will be 'it' while the rest of us hide."
# Genevieve claps in excitement.
# genevieve "Ooh, I feel like a kid again!"
# aj "Me too!"
# seb "AJ, you are a kid."
# AJ rolls her eyes.
# tai "Are we all ready?"
# tai "Let's cover our eyes."
# tai "LI, MC, cover your eyes!"
# You cover your eyes with your hands.
# tai "3...2...1..."
# tai "Go!"
# Liona "100...99...98..."
# You hear feet hitting the grass and everyone runs off to find a hiding space.
# LI continues counting down from 100.
# Liona "Three...two...one!"
# You take your hands from your eyes.
# LI grins at you.
# Liona "I'm going to check the roof terrace!"
# s3_mc "OK! Good luck!"
# LI runs off towards the Villa.
# You look around the empty lawn.
# thought "I'd better get searching!"
# Choiceseb "Where do I want to search? (you can only choose 3)"
# -Bedroom
# -Hideaway
# -Lounge
# -Beanbags

# You enter the bedroom.
# thought "Hmm... It looks empty."
# thought "But that's the whole point of hide and seek."
# thought "I should look around."
# You notice a human-shaped lump under the covers of Elladine and Nicky's bed.
# Choiceseb "There's definitely someone in there..."
# -Rip the covers off
# You sneak up to the bed and rip the covers off in one smooth motion.

# -Jump on it
# You prime with your elbow in front of you, and pile-drive onto the lump.
# Your elbow hits something soft. Pulling back the duvet, you see...

# -Fart on it
# You sit on the covers and fart.
# Nothing happens.
# You peek under the covers.

# It's nothing but pillows, arranged in the shape of a human.
# thought "They're so sneaky."
# There are a few possible hiding places left. Under the beds, behind the door, or in a large cabinet.
# Choiceseb "Where should I check next?"
# -Behind the door
# You sneak up to the door and whip it closed, revealing what's behind it.
# There's no one there.
# thought "Damn."
# You hear a giggle come from under the beds.
# Choiceseb "Where do I want to look next? (you can only choose once more)"
# -Under the beds (same scene as if directly looking under the beds)
# -In the cabinet
# You duck down
# You duck down next to the cabinet, trying to listen out for noises inside.
# You hear nothing, so you open the cabinet door.
# There is nothing inside.
# thought "Damn! Foiled again."
# thought "Oh, well. I should check another place in the Villa."


# -In a big cabinet
# You duck down next to the cabinet, trying to listen out for noises inside.
# You hear nothing, so you open the cabinet door.
# There is nothing inside.
# thought "Damn! Foiled again."
# thought "I should probably keep looking."
# You hear a quiet laugh coming from under one of the beds.
# Choiceseb "Where do I want to look next? (you can only choose once more)"
# -Under the beds (same scene as if directly looking under the beds)
# -Behind the door 
# You sneak up to the door and whip it closed, revealing what's behind it.
# There's no one there.
# thought "Damn."
# thought "Oh, well. I should check another place in the Villa."

# -Under the beds
# Slowly, without making a sound, you creep over to the bed on the far side of the room, so you can look under all of them at once.
# You duck down, getting down on your belly and...
# Genevieve and Seb are staring at you, only a few inches away.
# genevieve "Damn it."
# seb "Thought we'd get away with it when you fell for Mr. Pillow."
# s3_mc "That was crafty, sure, but I'm craftier."
# You help them out from under the bed.
# genevieve "I understand why cats find somewhere warm and small now. That was cosy!"
# seb "I wouldn't put it that way."
# genevieve "You don't like being pressed up against me?"
# seb "That's a whole other question."
# seb "Speaking of cats, I wonder if mine has had her kittens by now?"
# s3_mc "Your cat's pregnant? (makes only sense if Seb is not BFF)"
# seb "Yeah! She's due this week sometime."
# genevieve "Only you could turn a flirty conversation into one about kittens."
# seb "You're into it."
# genevieve "Sadly, I am."
# They head out towards the lawn, holding hands.


# You tip-toe into the hideaway, trying to keep quiet and surprise whoever might be in there.
# But then, sitting in the hot tub, you spot... 
# (if MC is coupled with Bill/Camilo i'ts Miki/Iona and Harry otherwise it's Miki/Iona and Bill/Camilo, depending on who was dumped)
# M/iona "So yeah, that's why I always make sure to scrub extra hard."
# B/H/camilo "Fascinating."
# They spot you, and Bill/Harry/Camilo waves at you.
# B/H/camilo "Hey, MC!"
# M/iona "Hey, girl! Join us!"
# Choiceseb "They want me to get in the hot tub..."
# -Hot tubs are overrated
# s3_mc "Like, you get all sweaty and there are so many bubbles."
# s3_mc "And someone could totally fart in it, and you'd have no idea."
# M/iona "That's not true..."
# M/iona "Is it Bill/Harry/Camilo?"
# Bill/Harry/Camilo looks down.
# B/H/camilo "No comment."

# -OK! I'm getting in!
# s3_mc "You guys have the right idea."
# You slip into the hot tub with them, and they cheer. The water is hot, but pleasant. (you get 😍 with Miki/Iona and Bill/Harry/Camilo)
# You settle your feet over a jet and let it massage you.

# -You're not playing!
# s3_mc "You're not taking it seriously!"
# B/H/camilo "Hey, Tai said we need to relax. So here we are."
# B/H/camilo "Relaxing!"

# M/iona "Settle this argument for us, MC."
# M/iona "Do you wash your legs in the shower?"
# s3_mc "How long have you been talking about this for?"
# B/H/camilo "Oh, ages. I'm in the 'no' team."
# B/H/camilo "The flowing water does all the work."
# M/iona "That's so gross!"
# M/iona "What do you think, MC?"
# Choiceseb "Do I wash my legs in the shower?"
# -This is silly
# -Yes
# s3_mc "Yes, of course. I wash everywhere. Otherwise you're not clean."
# s3_mc "If you just clean your pits, you have clean pits, and dirty everywhere else."
# M/iona "Thank you! (you get 😍 with Miki/Iona)"
# B/H/camilo "You guys are wasting so much shower gel."

# -No
# s3_mc "No! My legs don't get dirty, they're in clothes all day."
# s3_mc "Even here, where they're out, they don't get dirty."
# B/H/camilo "Thank you! (you get 😍 with Bill/Harry/Camilo)"
# B/H/camilo "If I had stinky legs, someone would have told me by now, 'hey, mate, your legs stink'."

# -I'd wash your legs, Camilo/Bill/Harry
# s3_mc "If you know what I mean."
# B/H/camilo "Hey... you can't make leg-washing sexy"
# M/iona "Yeah. Stick to washing LI's legs."

# M/iona "I've always washed mine. When I started growing hair on my legs, my mum didn't want me to shave yet, so she told me it was dirt."
# M/iona "Ever since then, I've done it every day."
# s3_mc "Well, this has been some riveting conversation..."
# You hear noises coming from the VIlla.
# s3_mc "What was that?"
# M/iona "I don't know!"
# s3_mc "You two should head to the lawn."
# M/iona "We're just getting comfortable..."
# s3_mc "Tough. I caught you. Back you go. I'll check out the noise."
# B/H/camilo "You're no fun."
# Miki/Iona and Bill/Harry/Camilo get out of the tub and start drying themselves off.
# thought "I should investigate that noise..."

# You enter the lounge. It seems to be empty, but on closer inspection, you spot something...
# There is a tuft of hair poking up behind one of the sofas.
# It looks like Nicky's.
# thought "Nicky is definitely hiding behind that sofa."
# Choiceseb "What should I do?"
# -Tell him to come out
# s3_mc "Nicky, I see your hair."
# s3_mc "It's over for you."
# Nicky pokes the rest of his head out, pouting.
# nicky "No fair. Hide and seek is hard when you have gorgeous hair like me."
# s3_mc "Life is so unfair, isn't it, Nicky?"

# -Trash talk Nicky
# s3_mc "Oh, I'm so glad Nicky isn't here. I can finally get some peace and quiet."
# s3_mc "You know, I really hate his... face."
# s3_mc "And his... arms."
# nicky "My arms?"
# His head pops out from behind the sofa.
# nicky "What's wrong with my arms?"
# s3_mc "Nothing. Just needed to get you out of your hidey-hole."
# nicky "I knew my arms were perfect. MC, you're well cheeky."

# -Sneak up on him
# You duck down, keeping on your tiptoes as you cross the room to the sofa.
# You round the corner and prepare to strike...
# Suddenly, Nicky jumps out at you.
# You scream, jumping backwards, as he laughs.
# nicky "Oh, MC. You underestimate me."
# s3_mc "No fair! I'm supposed to be finding you!"
# nicky "And you did. Congrats. I just thought I'd have some fun with it first. "

# You peek around the corner of the sofa and see Elladine curled up behind Nicky. She waves.
# elladine "Hi, MC. What's up."
# s3_mc "Nothing much. Just kicking this game's arse."
# elladine "Good for you!"
# nicky "This is the perfect afternoon, honestly. We get to just chillax here behind a sofa, and you do all the hard work."
# elladine "I'd rather be doing the catching. At least then you have some control."
# elladine "What do you think, MC?"
# Choiceseb "Would I rather hide or seek?"
# -Hide
# s3_mc "You guys have just been sitting down all day."
# s3_mc "I've been running around like a headless chicken."
# s3_mc "I'd much rather be in your shoes."
# elladine "Yeah, I suppose you're right."

# -Seek
# s3_mc "Then when LI and I win, we get bragging rights."
# nicky "Aw, I want bragging rights."
# elladine "Yeah, I suppose you're right."

# -Not play at all
# s3_mc "I'm finding this kind of boring, if I'm honest."
# s3_mc "It's a game for kids. I don't think it was designed to entertain adults."
# elladine "Hey, I'm having a good time."

# elladine "I dunno why we stop playing these games when we get to adulthood."
# elladine "One day you play for the last time, and just never play again. It's sad."
# nicky "Not for us! I'm 24 and I'm loving this. I'd say that's a win for my childhood self."
# elladine "I wish there was a playground for adults, with enough room for us to fit on the slides and stuff."
# elladine "Maybe we can find one when we get out. Or just go to a kid's one."
# nicky "We can't go to a kids' one! They'll arrest us."
# Choiceseb "Elladine wants to go to a playground..."
# -It's weird
# -I'm in!
# s3_mc "Nicky, it won't be weird if we go at night or something."
# s3_mc "Sometimes you have to just be a kid again."
# nicky "OK, decent point. I'm in, then."
# nicky "Ooh, we have plans to hang out on the outside!"
# nicky "And my teachers said I was anti-social..."

# -Maybe an adult one
# s3_mc "I'd feel weird on a kids one, and probably squashed."
# elladine "That has to exist, right? Like, somewhere in London."
# nicky "Something to make all the ageing hipsters feel young again."
# elladine "Let's find it."
# nicky "Maybe when we get out."
# nicky "Although, I don't know how much time we'll all end up spending together..."

# elladine "I took it as a given we were meeting up outside, babe."
# nicky "As long as you play your cards right."
# They start making eyes at each other.
# s3_mc "I'm gonna search somewhere else."
# s3_mc "Get over to the lawn, losers."

# As you approach the beanbags, you notice that they are piled up in an unusual way, with what looks like a little peep hole.
# It almost seems like someone is hiding beneath them...
# You sneak a little closer and hear two voices, chatting about what they're going to do when they win the game.
# Choiceseb "There's definitely someone in that fort... (no further reactions)"

# s3_mc "Did you hear that ghost?(ghost)"
# R/L: That horribly unconvincing ghost?(ghost)
# R/L: I may have heard something, yeah.(ghost)
# R/L: And can I just say, that getup looks even more impressive in real life than on the telly.
# R/L: And can I just say, I couldn't have asked for a better-looking girl to find me. That getup looks incredible.
# R/L: And you are even more stunning in real life, by the way. Whatever you're wearing.
# s3_mc "How long have you been in there?"
# R/L: Not long. Thought I'd join the game. Give you a fun surprise to find.
# [he_she] winks at you. You blush harder.
# R/L: I've been wanting to meet you for ages, MC. Watching you on the telly, I knew we'd get along.

# R/L: Well, the thing that made you really stick out to me was your secret in the first challenge.

# (Rafi):
# R: I'm an actor.

# R: I can sing and dance, too.
# s3_mc "Triple threat!"
# R: Yes! Exactly!
# R: Anything else you want to know? I'm an open book. (if not chosen last)

# (Lily):
# L: I'm a student, studying Industrial Design.
# s3_mc "What does that involve?"
# L: It's a lot of building, and not a lot of essays and theory, which suits me to the bone.
# L: I hate that kind of stuff. I just want to crack on with my hands.
# L: Excuse the pun.
# L: But I do influencing, too. You know, online. Just to pay the bills.
# L: It must be amazing being a scientist/musician/pro athlete/model, though.
# s3_mc "It has its moments."
# L: Anything else you want to know? I'm an open book. (if not chosen last)

# -Where are you from?
# (Rafi):
# R: Born and raised in Bromley. But my parents are from Egypt.
# R: Growing up in London. It's always so loud there.
# He pauses for a moment. You both listen to how silent the Villa is. He shrugs in response.
# R: It's so quiet here! It's weird!
# R Anything else you want to know? I'm an open book. (if not chosen last)

# (Lily):
# L: I was born in North West London, but my parents are from Portugal.
# s3_mc "Have you ever been?"
# L: Yeah, when I was a kid, but I don't remember much of it.

# s3_mc "What does that mean?"
# L: That I'm cute.
# L: Which is true.
# L: Anything else you want to know? I'm an open book. (if not chosen last)

# -Do I look good on TV?
# R/L: Of course you do.

# R/L: The confidence! I like it.
# R/L: Very sexy.

# -Maybe a little bit
# s3_mc "I don't think being picked for Love Island makes me special. I think it means I make good TV. And those are different things."
# R/L: Come off it, MC! People don't want to watch ordinary people doing ordinary stuff.
# R/L: They want to watch hot people doing cool stuff.
# R/L: Therefore, you're hot and cool.

# s3_mc "You don't even know me."
# R/L: But I'd like to.
# R/L: If you'd like that.

# Everyone else shakes their heads.
# You frown, until you see LI walking towards you, laughing with...
# Another new Islander.
# LI cracks a joke, and the new Islander gives [him_her] a playful shove, leaving a hand on [his_her] arm a little too long.
# Liona "Hey everyone! This is Lily/Rafi, who I found in the shower!"

# Lily
# -23, from North West London

# R/L: I know exactly who you are, MC.
# R/L: Even if LI doesn't.
# Liona "I'm sorry..."
# Rafi/Lily puts a reassuring hand on your arm and gives you a smile. LI's eyes flashes to it.
# Liona "Who are you?"
# R/L: I'm Rafi/Lily.
# s3_mc "I found Rafi/Lily in a wardrobe."
# R/L: She pretended to be a ghost outside the door.

# "Welcome back!"
# "Previously on Love Island, the games for AJ's birthday began with Hide and Seek..."
# "I last played Hide and Seek on a blind date."
# "She found me in the car park after an hour."
# "But only because she thought I'd left!"
# "MC was quicker finding Rafi/Lily..."
# R/L: I've been wanting to meet you for ages, MC. Watching you on telly, I knew we'd get along.
# s3_mc "Oh yeah? What is it about me?"
# "And up today!"
# "A challenge will reveal secrets..."
# R/L: So whose mum thinks someone is the sexiest Islander?
# "But something's fishy..."
# genevieve "My poor hair!"
# s3_mc "This is just like those games at the funfair!"
# "Looks like our Islanders are going to have a whale of a time."

# Rafi and Lily wait at the challenge stage, both holding fishing rods.
# Elladine looks nervous, but Nicky puts an arm around her shoulder and she snuggles close.
# LI links arms with you.
# As you approach, Lily/Rafi winks LI, who smiles back.
# thought "Is Lily/Rafi grafting on LI?"
# thought "Right under my nose?"
# Rafi/Lily flashes a winning smile at you.
# R/L: Welcome, welcome! You're here to play...
# L/R: Hook A Secret!
# Rafi strikes a dashing pose with his fishing rod.
# R: A fishing rod isn't my usual style, but I can make it work.
# L: You look like Aquariums Monthly centrefold.
# R: I'll have you know, that issue sold out in every shop.
# R/L: MC, you're up first. Come and get a fishing rod!
# You approach the paddling pool and pick up one of the rods.
# R/L: Looking fine, MC!
# Choiceseb "Rafi/Lily thinks I look good..."
# -You know you love it
# You grin, then pout at an invisible camera.
# R/L: I never thought I'd say this, but you'll have our hosts...hooked.
# L/R: Mm, but I think LI will really make the fishing rod work.
# Tai/Ciaran/Yasmin/Camilo/AJ grins and bows. 
# Bill/Harry grins at you and squeezes your hand. 
# Liona "Well, I reckon MC steals the show."

# -You look great too
# s3_mc "I never thought fishing was sexy until this moment."
# Lily poses like an ice queen with her arms folded, while Rafi gives an elaborate bow.
# R/L: Clearly, we have our guests... hooked.
# L/R: Mm, but I think LI will really make the fishing rod work.
# Tai/Ciaran/Yasmin/Camilo/AJ grins and bows. 
# Bill/Harry grins at you and squeezes your hand.
# Liona "Well, I reckon MC steals the show."

# -LI will look even better
# s3_mc "LI will steal the show."
# Tai/Ciaran/Yasmin/Camilo/AJ grins and bows. (you get 😍 with Tai/Ciaran/Camilo)
# Bill/Harry grins at you and squeezes your hand. (you get 😍 with Bill/Harry)
# L/R: LI certainly has the Islanders... hooked.
# R/L: I don't know, MC looks fantastic today.
# Liona "Yeah, I reckon MC steals the show."

# s3_mc "A fishing rod's out of plaice in my wardrobe, babe."
# s3_mc "You know, plaice like the fish?"
# B/H/yasmin "Huh?"
# C/T/Cam/aj "Something's fishy, babe, and I think it's your jokes. (you get 😂 with Tai/Ciaran/Camilo/AJ)"
# "Don't worry MC. You have the sole of a comedian."
# "Get it? Sole? Soul?"
# "I'm available for work dos, birthdays, weddings..."
# R/L: While you've been in the Villa, your nearest and dearest have been watching closely.
# R/L: And we've gathered a selection of secrets from them here in this very pool.
# R/L: Take it in turns to hook out a secret and read it out...
# L/R: And everyone hears the juicy details.
# thought "I wonder if my friends know something we don't."
# LI shifts closer to you, looking nervous.
# Liona "This feels weird..."
# Liona "Will there be something secret that comes out?"
# thought "[he_she] seems worried. What secrets is [he_she] thinking about?"
# Choiceseb "LI thinks secrets will be spilled..."
# -I'm not worried
# s3_mc "It's all just part of the fun."
# s3_mc "I'm feeling chill about it."
# Liona "Good. Yeah, that's good..."

# -I hope they're not about me
# s3_mc "This could be dramatic..."
# s3_mc "Hopefully the secrets will be about other people."

# -Have you got any secrets?
# s3_mc "Is there something you don't want revealed?"
# Liona "Hmm? No! No, it's just that I'm not into more drama."

# You catch LI looking between Rafi and Lily, with a worried frown.
# L/R: When you're up, you'll choose who you think the secret's about...
# R/L: By dumping water on them!
# Genevieve puts her hands over her hair protectively.
# L/R: If you're right, you get a point.
# R/L: And if you're wrong, you've thrown water on someone.
# L/R: It's a win-win.
# R/L: The winning Islander gets to soak the person they think is the hottest.
# R/L: MC, it's time for you to make your move.
# Choiceseb "I have to hook out a secret with the fishing rod..."
# -I love those games!
# s3_mc "This is just like the games at the funfair!"
# You draw your arm back, then cast smoothly. AJ claps as the bait neatly hits the water.
# aj "Go MC!"

# -I have no idea what to do
# s3_mc "Is this the time when I say I've never fished in my life?"
# aj "Keep your hand near the reel, pull your arm back..."
# You follow her instructions, then cast. For a second, you can't even see where the line went.
# aj "The bait's meant to go in the water!"
# R/L: Ahem. No conferring amongst the contestants.
# You cast again, and this time your bait hits the water.

# -Go by instinct
# s3_mc "I've seen people fishing on TV."
# s3_mc "What could go wrong?"
# You close your eyes, then cast.
# When you open your eyes, you can't even see where the line went.
# aj "MC, what are you doing?"
# aj "The bait's meant to go in the water!"
# R/L: Ahem. No conferring amongst the contestants.
# You cast again, and this time your bait hits the water.

# You lift a laminated secret from the pool, then read it out.
# s3_mc "Blank's mum thinks blank is the sexiest Islander."
# R/L: So whose mum thinks someone is the sexiest Islander?
# seb "Well, it can't be my mum."
# Genevieve puts a hand on Seb's shoulder, and he smiles back at her. (Seb not as BFF)
# You put a hand on Seb's shoulder, and he smiles back at you. (Seb as BFF)
# thought "I don't think Tai's in touch with his mum, so I don't see it being her."
# thought "So first things first..."
# Choiceseb "...whose mum would fancy someone in the Villa?"
# -My mum...
# You pick up the bucket and survey the Islanders.
# s3_mc "I think..."
# s3_mc "...it's my mum."
# You pour the bucket of water over your own head. It's freezing cold.

# -Ciaran's mum...
# You pick up the bucket and survey the Islanders.
# s3_mc "I think..."
# s3_mc "...it's Ciaran's mum."
# You dump the bucket of water over Ciaran's head. He gasps and shrieks.
# ciaran "Aah!"

# -Yasmin's mum...
# You pick up the bucket and survey the Islanders.
# s3_mc "I think..."
# s3_mc "...it's Yasmin's mum."
# You dump the bucket of water over Yasmin's head. She gasps and shrieks.
# yasmin "Aah!"

# -Harry's mum...
# You pick up the bucket and survey the Islanders.
# s3_mc "I think..."
# s3_mc "...it's Harry's mum."
# You dump the bucket of water over Harry's head. He gasps and shrieks.
# harry "Aah!"

# R/L: The answer is...
# R/L: Harry's mum!
# s3_mc "I knew it! (if you picked Harry as the answer)"
# s3_mc "Oh, really? Agh, I couldn't have been more wrong. (if you didn't pick Harry as the answer)"
# Harry grins sheepishly.
# harry "That's Mum for you."
# harry "Am I really going to have to work out what my mum's type is?"
# L/R: No, that's for MC to uncover.
# Choiceseb "Who would Harry's mum think is the sexiest Islander...?"
# -Me, obviously
# s3_mc "I think..."
# s3_mc "...that Harry's mum thinks that I am the sexiest Islander."
# You dump the bucket of water over your head.
# L/R: Correct!
# harry "At least Mum has good taste, even if this does feel a bit weird."

# -LI, of course
# s3_mc "I think..."
# s3_mc "Harry's mum thinks LI is the sexiest Islander."
# You dump a bucket over LI's head.
# Liona "I'm flattered! But I'm pretty sure I know who it is."
# L/R: Sorry, that's not right!
# L/R: It was you, MC!
# s3_mc "Wow. Harry's mum must have good taste."

# -Rafi/Lily!
# s3_mc "I think..."
# s3_mc "Harry's mum thinks Rafi/Lily is the sexiest Islander."
# You dump a bucket over Rafi's/Lily's head.
# R/L: I'm flattered! But I'm pretty sure I know who it is.
# L/R: Sorry, that's not right!
# L/R: It was you, MC! 
# s3_mc "Wow. Harry's mum must have good taste."

# (if you did bits with Tai behind the waterfall and are coupled with thim):
# R/L: And now... it's Elladine!
# Elladine strides forwards and takes the fishing rod.
# elladine "Ready."
# Elladine hoists the fishing rod and casts with a determined expression.
# After a couple of tries, she picks up the laminated secret and turns it over.
# elladine "Oh!"
# elladine "Blanks pals are delighted that MC finally fulfilled his dream of a waterfall hookup."
# (MC not coupled with Tai, Camilo/Bill not dumped and was coupled with MC on day 3 or/and is currently coupled with MC):
# Camilo/Bill glances at you, and bites his lip. Elladine looks between you with a worried frown.
# After a few minutes of dithering, Elladine pours the water over her own head.
# R/L: We all know that's not true.
# elladine "I know, but I don't want to cause drama..."
# L/R: Drama's the name of the game, hun.
# L/R: The answer is... Tai!
# B/camilo "Wait, what?"
# B/camilo "Can we have a quick chat, MC?"
# Camilo/Bill ushers you to one side. The rest of the Islanders pretend not to pay attention.
# (MC was not coupled with Camilo/Bill on day 3):
# B/camilo "I didn't realise that had happened with Tai..."
# He sighs.
# B/camilo "Can't help feeling surprised."
# B/camilo "I suppose what I'm really asking is... is there anything you'd like to say?"
# B/camilo "I feel like things are good between us."
# B/camilo "But if they're not..."
# Choiceseb "Is there anything I want to tell Camilo/Bill about my date with Tai?"
# -You're the one I want
# -It wasn't anything serious
# -I'm sorry (MC was coupled with Camilo/Bill on day 3)
# -I wish I'd told you
# s3_mc "If I was doing it again, I'd have told you."
# s3_mc "But what I do know is that you're the one I'm into."

# s3_mc "I picked you."
# B/camilo "I'm glad you did."
# Bill/Camilo glances over at Tai appreciatively.
# B/camilo "And, I mean, I don't blame you. Not gonna lie."
# Bill/Camilo takes your hand, and you make your way back to the group.
# B/camilo "Let's get on with the challenge."
# (MC coupled with Tai):
# Tai glances at you with a sidelong grin, and Elladine catches his eye.
# elladine "Oh, I know this one."
# She throws the bucket straight over Tai. He shakes his hair out energetically.
# tai "That's the one, I can tell you that."
# Up on the platform, Lily gasps dramatically.
# L/R: What an image, am I right?
# R/L: Elladine is... correct!
# tai "Course she is."
# Tai winks at you.

# R/L: Next up... our musical legend, Yasmin!
# Yasmin dips her hand in the pool thoughtfully.
# L/R: No interfering with the fish!
# After a few tries, Yasmin hooks her secret and reads it out.
# yasmin "Blank's sibling thinks blank won't resist them."
# She gives the group a quick once-over.
# yasmin "I believe in gut instincts. I'm going with..."
# She picks up the bucket and pours half of it over Genevieve...
# genevieve "My poor hair!"
# ...and the other half on Seb.
# Seb shakes out his hair like a wet dog.
# Though they're totally bedraggled, he and Genevieve give each other little sideways smiles.
# thought "Looks like love might be in the air..."
# R/L: I'm sorry to say that Yasmin's wrong.
# R/L: The answer is...
# Lily/Rafi does a drumroll on the podium while Rafi opens the envelope.
# R/L: Lily's/Rafi's sibling thinks LI won't resist her.
# Bill/Harry/Camilo/Tai/Yasmin/AJ grins at Lily/Rafi.
# Lily/Rafi grins right back.
# Ciaran's eyes widen, and he smiles shyly at Lily.
# R/L: Aw, that's not fair.
# R/L: Poor MC, you should get some love too!
# Choiceseb "People really think LI is interested in Lily/Rafi..."
# -That's hilarious
# s3_mc "That's the funniest thing I've heard all day."
# s3_mc "LI would never be into someone else..."
# LI quickly kisses your cheek.
# Liona "Of course, babe! Of course. (you get 😍 with LI)"

# -Why would they think that?
# s3_mc "They must have seen something to make them think that..."
# s3_mc "Should I be worried?"
# B/H/Cam/AJ/T/yasmin "Course not."
# ciaran "What? No! Of course not!"

# -What have you been up to, LI?
# s3_mc "They must have seen something to make them think that..."
# s3_mc "Should I be worried?"
# B/H/Cam/AJ/T/yasmin "Course not."
# ciaran "What? No! Of course not!"

# [he_she] glances over at Lily/Rafi, who blows [him_her] a kiss.
# L/R: I'll take all this as a compliment.
# Rafi/Lily elbows Lily/Rafi in the ribs.
# R/L: Next up!
# R/L: Our favourite lovable puppy, Ciaran.
# Ciaran approaches the pool with a bashful expression. He takes the rod from Yasmin, then expertly hooks out a secret.
# ciaran "Blank has had blank while in the Villa."
# Ciaran pursues his lips, and looks around at the Islanders.
# ciaran "It looks like the name's a short one, so..."
# He dumps the bucket over Seb's head.
# Genevieve gives Seb a comforting pat on the shoulder.
# genevieve "Poor you."
# R/L: Ciaran is... correct!
# R/L: What's Seb had while in the Villa?
# ciaran "I think Seb's had... off milk in his tea while in the Villa."
# seb "No way, you'd have heard about it."
# seb "I take my tea seriously."
# L/R: Sorry to say, Ciaran, but that is incorrect.
# R/L: But anyone can guess for a special bonus point!
# R/L: But Ciaran was right about one thing. It's not a name, and it's not anything dodgy.
# The Islanders murmur amongst themselves, trying to come up with ideas for the answer.
# Choiceseb "What could Seb have had while in the Villa?"
# -Hayfever
# s3_mc "Hayfever?"
# Seb shakes his wet hair back from his face.
# seb "If I didn't have it before, I do now."
# genevieve "That's not how hayfever works, hun."
# seb "It's not...?"
# L/R: Sorry, MC, that is... incorrect!
# L/R: Seb's had kittens while in the Villa.
# R/L: His car. His cat's had kittens. Otherwise it would be weird.

# -Kittens
# s3_mc "Kittens?"
# s3_mc "Or, like... his cat."
# s3_mc "It'd be weird for a person to have kittens."
# s3_mc "You know what I mean!"
# R/L: That's correct!

# -Kids' songs in his head
# s3_mc "I think Seb's been singing kids' songs in the shower."
# seb "I have not."
# s3_mc "I could swear I heard you humming the Bianca the Bricklayer theme tune yesterday."
# seb "That was a... er, band you don't know."
# R/L: Good call, MC, but that guess was... incorrect! 
# R/L: The correct answer was...
# R/L: Seb's had kittens while in the Villa.
# L/R: His cat. His cat's had kittens. Otherwise it would be weird.

# Seb gives Rafi and Lily a very, very focused look.
# seb "Is. This. True?"
# Rafi/Lily waves the envelope.
# R/L: That's what the answer says!
# Seb turns to Genevieve with an unusual spark of excitement on his face. (Seb is not BFF)
# Seb turns to you with an unusual spark of excitement on his face. (Seb is BFF)
# seb "Can you believe it?"
# Genevieve puts her arm around him.(Seb is not BFF)
# genevieve "I'm so happy for you.(Seb is not BFF)"
# s3_mc "Send us all pics!(Seb is not BFF)"
# seb "I can't wait to see her."
# s3_mc "I have to see pictures!(Seb is BFF)"
# seb "You can come and visit.(Seb is BFF)"
# R/L: As much as everyone loves cats, we've got a challenge to play!
# R/L: Up next, the lovely MC.
# You take the fishing rod from Ciaran, and strike a pose.
# With a deep breath, you cast your line. When you hook out a secret, Rafi/Lily claps.
# R/L: Good going!
# You read out the secret...
# s3_mc "Blank's brother thinks his partner's blank skills aren't up to scratch."
# thought "I wonder what the skills are...?"
# thought "But first I need to figure out whose brother it is."
# You pick up the bucket and cast your eye over the Islanders.
# thought "The secret said 'his partner', so it has to be about one of the boys."
# Choiceseb "Whose brother thinks his partner's skills are lacking?"
# -Bill's brother... (if he wasn't dumped)
# You dump the water on Bill, who grins and shakes the water off his head.

# -Camilo's brother... (if he wasn't dumped)
# You dump the water on Camilo, who grins and shakes the water off his head.

# -Harry's brother...
# You dump the water on Harry, who grins and shakes the water off his head.

# -Seb's brother.. (doesn't makes sense if he's BFF as MC knows he's an only child)

# -Rafi's brother... (doesn't make sense as he is not partnered up)

# R/L: The results are in. And I can reveal that MC... is...
# R/L: Incorrect! (if you picked Harry/Seb/Rafi)
# R/L: Correct!(if you picked Bill/Camilo)
# B/camilo "Nice one! (you get 🙂 with Bill/Camilo)(if you picked Bill/Camilo)"
# R/L: The brother in the secret is BIll's/Camilo's.
# B/camilo "What's he been chatting about now?"
# L/R: That's for MC to reveal.
# L: So Bill's/Camilo's brother thinks MC/Miki/Iona isn't good at something...
# R/L: So Bill's/Camilo's brother thinks/Miki/Iona isn't good at something...
# thought "What does Bill's/Camilo's brother think I'm/Miki's/Iona's not good at?"
# Choices:
# -Kissing
# s3_mc "Kissing?"
# M/iona "I'm great at kissing!"
# B/camilo "Hey, I've got no complaints. (Bill/Camilo coupled with MC/Miki/Iona)"

# -Board games
# s3_mc "Board games?"
# B/camilo "Aw, don't sell yourself short. (MC coupled with Bill/Camilo)"
# B/camilo "You can play Monopoly, right?(MC coupled with Bill/Camilo)"
# B/camilo "That's a big thing in my family.(MC coupled with Bill/Camilo)"
# M/iona "Why would board games matter to your brother?"
# Bill's/Camilo's eyes widen.
# B/camilo "OK, now's not the time. We can chat about it later."
# B/camilo "I just hope you know how to play Monopoly. It's a big thing in my family."

# -Tidying
# s3_mc "Tidying?"
# B/camilo "That's legit. You could be a bit tidier, babe."

# L/R: Now for the big reveal.
# L/R: MC is...
# R: Correct! (if you picked board games)
# R: Incorrect! (if you picked kissing or tidying)
# L: The right answer is... (if you picked kissing or tidying)
# L: Bill's/Camilo's brother thinks MC's board game skills aren't up to scratch.
# R/L: Bill's/Camilo's brother thinks Miki/Iona isn't good enough at board games for him.
# bill "Paul, what are you thinking, giving away our game night secrets?"
# camilo "Tom, what are you thinking, giving away our game night secrets?"
# B/camilo "Monopoly's a serious business."
# L/R: Next up, it's LI.
# Liona "Alright, let's do this."
# LI fishes out a secret. [his_her] eyes widen.
# Liona "I can't decide that!"
# L/R: Let's hear it!
# Liona "LI's bestie thinks blank is the hottest person in the Villa."
# LI looks at you straight away, swinging the bucket from side to side.
# Then [he_she] glances over at Lily/Rafi.
# Choiceseb "Could LI's bestie think  Lily/Rafi is the hottest person in the Villa?"
# -Go with your instinct, LI
# s3_mc "Pick whoever feels right."
# Liona "I can't choose!"

# -You can't pick Lily/Rafi over me!
# s3_mc "I can't believe you're considering someone else!"
# Liona "I can't choose!"

# -I just want someone splashed, I don't mind who
# s3_mc "All I want is more people getting a soaking."
# Liona "I can't choose!"

# Silence descends over the lawn while everyone stares at LI.
# [he_she] is completely frozen with indecision.
# Eventually, [he_she] throws the bucket of water. The water arcs through the air...
# ...and splashes all over you...
# ...and Lily/Rafi.
# Liona "That was an accident!"
# Choiceseb "Does LI think Lily/Rafi is the hottest in the Villa?"
# -LI obviously picked me
# s3_mc "LI was looking at me when [he_she] threw that bucket."

# -Looks like divided loyalty
# s3_mc "So you reckon your best friend thinks Lily/Rafi is the hottest?"
# Liona "I was looking at you when I threw the bucket!"

# -Foul play!
# s3_mc "Foul!"
# s3_mc "We're only meant to pick one person. Choice disallowed!"
# Liona "I was looking at you when I threw the bucket!"

# L/R: I don't know, it seemed a lot like [he_she] was looking at me.
# L/R: Right, LI?
# Liona "No. I mean yes! I mean..."
# Rafi/Lily clears [his_her] throat meaningfully.
# R/L: No matter who [he_she] meant to choose, LI is incorrect.
# R/L: The answer is...
# R/L: Genevieve.
# genevieve "Me?!"
# seb "Yeah, check it out."
# Genevieve hooks an arm around Seb's waist and kisses his cheek.
# L/R: Now up... it's Genevieve!
# Genevieve takes a few goes to hook a secret. She reads it out...
# genevieve "This couple's friends got together to analyse their relationship."
# genevieve "Results say they're a perfect match!"
# genevieve "Ooh!"
# nicky "Me and Elladine!"
# aj "Camilo and pancakes!"
# genevieve "It's hard to decide, but..."
# She sneaks a glance at Seb.
# Then with a quick movement, she throws the bucket over both of them.
# genevieve "It's got to be us, right?"
# Seb laughs as if it's a joke, but both she and Seb look properly pleased.
# R/L: Good try, but that is... incorrect!
# (Taking the gem choice to get to know Rafi/Lily better and say you're interested):
# R/L: The answer is Miki/Iona and Bill/Camilo/Harry!
# Bill/Camilo/Harry and Miki/Iona smile at each other, and Camilo puts an arm around Miki's/Iona's shoulders.
# B/H/camilo "That's us, a perfect match!"
# Liona "That's a shame, I hoped it would be us..."
# Choiceseb "LI thinks we should have been the perfect match..."
# -At least we didn't get wet
# -It should have been us
# s3_mc "We're a better couple than Bill/Harry/Camilo and Miki/Iona."
# LI sighs.
# Liona "Yeah, you're right."

# -Bill/Camilo/Harry and Miki/Iona deserve it
# s3_mc "It's sweet to see Bill/Harry/Camilo and Miki/Iona get recognised."
# s3_mc "They're a nice couple."
# Liona "Yeah, you're right."

# (Taking the gem choice to get to know Rafi/Lily better and say you're not interested or not taking the gem choice to get to Rafi/Lily better):
# R/L: The answer is MC and LI!
# LI smiles at you, and puts an arm around your shoulders.
# B/H/Cam/T/Y/aj "That's us, a perfect match!"
# ciaran "I wonder why Genevieve didn't think it was us?"
# Choiceseb "Are we a perfect match?"
# -I'm just glad I didn't get soaked again
# s3_mc "I didn't fancy getting a bucket chucked on my head again."

# -Of course it was us!
# s3_mc "We're endgame. End of."
# Liona "You've got that right.(you get 😍 with LI)"

# -I'm surprised we were the answer
# s3_mc "I wonder what made us stand out?"
# Liona "You being incredibly hot, for one thing."

# LI looks over at Seb and Genevieve, who are soaked from head to foot, and laughs.
# L/R:MC, you're up!
# R/L: Will you sink or swim?
# You take the fishing rod from Genevieve, and flex your casting muscles.
# The headline reads...
# s3_mc "Rafi's/Lily's friends are sure Rafi/Lily would love to see blank covered in chocolate."
# Rafi/Lily gives a theatrical gasp.
# R/L: Goodness me!
# Choiceseb "Rafi's/Lily's friends say Rafi/Lily wants to see an Islander covered in chocolate. But who?"
# -LI
# -BFF
# s3_mc "I think the answer is..."
# s3_mc "...BFF."
# You strike a dramatic pose, then tip the bucket over BFF's head.
# BFF laughs, looking very bedraggled.
# Lily/Rafi whistles appreciatively.
# L/R: I'm afraid that's...incorrect!
# R/L: The answer's MC.

# -Me
# s3_mc "I think the answer is..."
# s3_mc "....Me."
# L/R: You can't pick yourself...
# R/L: Oh, she can.
# R/L: That is the correct answer! (you get 😍 with Rafi)

# -The Narrator
# s3_mc "I think the answer is..."
# s3_mc "....The Narrator."
# "Oh gosh, Rafi/Lily, you shouldn't have!"
# "And here's me without my fancy shoes today..."
# Rafi/Lily and Lily/Rafi exchange a look.
# L/R: That is... incorrect!
# "...oh."
# R/L: The answer's MC.

# Rafi/Lily and Lily/Rafi adjourn to calculate the results.

# tai "If we let the air out of the pool inflatables and spread them out..."
# tai "It'll make a sweet slide!"
# LI leans closer to you and speaks softly into your ear.
# Liona "I'd really enjoy getting wet with you."
# (choosing the gem option from day 9 part 2 to get to know Rafi/Lily better and tell them you're interested):
# Over LI's shoulder, you catch Rafi's/Lily's eye. 
# [he_she] gives you a slow, flirtatious smile.
# thought "It would mean a whole lot more grafting time..."
# Choiceseb "Shall we do a slip and slide?"
# -Sounds like fun (gem choice)
# -I'd rather not
# Liona "Aw, it would be fun to unwind after the challenge."
# L/R: It's OK, Liona "I'll go sliding with you."
# Choiceseb "Lily/Rafi might graft on LI if I don't stay!"
# -Let's slide (gem choice)
# -No thanks, I'm hungry
# s3_mc "I bet we can do games another day."
# Along with the rest of the Islanders, you troop inside for a well-earned dinner.
# thought "Maybe Bill/Camilo will cook up something tasty?"

# Gem choice:
# aj "This will be amazing!"
# "Not content with today's soaking, the Islanders are back for more."
# "Maybe they should've kept the wellies on!"
# Elladine organises everyone to spread their waterproofs onto the lawn.
# Then everyone pitches in pouring the water out from the buckets and paddling pool.
# Soon, the whole lawn is soaked and slippery.
# R/L: Let's go!
# Everyone piles in. with shrieks and cheers, they skid and slide.
# Some are successful...
# yasmin "I'll win this. I can feel it."
# L/R: You can't win a slide, babe.
# yasmin "I can."
# ...while others are less so.
# elladine "My hair! My hair!"
# M/iona "How is your hair in my mouth?"
# M/iona "My mouth!"
# But everyone has a great time.
# tai "I'll be the penguin, and you be the shark!"
# While everyone's splashing, you find yourself next to LI, who holds out a hand.
# Liona "Fancy a slide?"
# LilyRafi scrambles up, and reaches for LI's hand. (depending who's grafting LI)
# L/R: Why, certainly.
# LI smiles.
# Liona "Oh! Well, if you like..."
# Choiceseb "Lily/Rafi wants to slide with LI..."
# -You go ahead
# -That's OK, I'll slide with Rafi/Lily (depending who's grafting MC)
# s3_mc "Rafi/Lily, would you slide with me?"
# R/L: Oh, absolutely.
# The rest of the Islanders clear off the slide, and the two of you take your places.
# bff "Three... two... one..."
# Choiceseb "How shall I slide this time?"
# -I'll do a dance
# You grin at Rafi/Lily and brace yourself.
# bff "Go!"
# You dance along and it goes perfectly until...

# -I'll slide along on my front
# You grin at Rafi/Lily and brace yourself.
# bff "Go!"
# You propel yourself like a caterpillar while the others cheer.
# It's going great until...

# -I'll race Rafi/Lily
# You grin at Rafi/Lily and brace yourself.
# bff "Go!"
# You skid along the slide, and you're right in front when...

# R/L: Aah!
# Rafi/Lily slips and crashes to the ground next to you.
# R/L: Well. Hello, there.
# Rafi/Lily reaches to brush wet hair out of your eyes.
# Then [he_she] hesitates, [his_her] fingertips almost touching your hair. [he_she] glances over at LI.
# When [he_she] speaks close to your ear, [his_her] voice is soft.
# R/L: I'd love to discuss this later...
# [he_she] scrambles up and the others pile onto the slide.
# Once you and Rafi/Lily are back on the lawn, [he_she] puts an arm around your shoulders.
# R/L: That was so much fun. Thanks for helping it happen.

# -I want to slide with LI
# s3_mc "I'll take that slide, thanks."
# LI beams at you.
# The rest of the Islanders clear off the slide, and the two of you take your places.
# bff "Three... two... one..."
# Choiceseb "How shall I slide this time?"
# -I'll do a dance
# You grin at LI and brace yourself.
# bff "Go!"
# You dance along and it goes perfectly until...

# You grin at LI and brace yourself.

# You grin at LI and brace yourself.
# bff "Go!"
# You skid along the slide, and you're right in front when...

# Liona "Aah!"
# LI slips, grabs you, and you both crash to the ground.
# You end up on top of LI, who smiles at you.
# LI reaches to brush your wet hair out of your eyes.
# Choiceseb "Maybe I could kiss [him_her]..."
# -Race to the end
# -Help LI up
# You scramble to your feet, find your balance, and take LI's hand.
# Liona "Thanks, LI."
# Liona "Always appreciating a helping hand."

# -Kiss LI
# You lean closer, and kiss LI deeply.
# [he_she] wraps [his_her] arms around you straight away and pulls you tight against [him_her].
# Water splashes over the two of you, and you break apart.
# bff "Get a room, lovebirds."

# Once you and LI are back on the lawn, [he_she] puts an arm around your shoulders.
# Liona "That was so much fun. Thanks for helping it happen."

# After dinner, everyone's exhausted.
# While you wash your face and get ready for bed, you catch sight of Rafi/Lily yawning in the reflection of the mirror.
# s3_mc "Enjoy your first day?"
# R/L: Totally.
# R/L: I can't believe it's only been a day!
# R/L: Is it always this full on?
# Choiceseb "Rafi/Lily thinks it's full on in the Villa..."
# -It's like this all the time
# s3_mc "You'll get used to it."
# s3_mc "We'll have challenges, breakfasts, swimming..."
# Rafi/Lily grins in the mirror.

# -Oh, this is only the beginning
# s3_mc "Trust me, it's full on."
# s3_mc "You'll look back on today and think how quiet it was."

# -We'll have lazy time tomorrow
# s3_mc "I bet we'll be sunbathing all morning."
# s3_mc "You'll look back on today and feel nostalgic that you had so much going on."

# R/L: Well, I'm looking forward to tomorrow.
# R/L: And getting to know you better, too.
# Liona "Getting to know who better?"
# LI comes to the sink to brush [his_her] teeth, standing shoulder to shoulder with you.
# You can feel the warmth of [his_her] arm against yours.
# R/L: Getting to know you. You know, youse. Y'all. Everyone.
# thought "I feel like Rafi/Lily meant me personally."
# LI grins around [his_her] toothbrush and nods amiably.
# [he_she] doesn't seem to have noticed anything off in Rafi's tone.
# Rafi/Lily catches your eye in the mirror, and smiles.
# thought "Is Rafi/Lily flirting with me? Right in front of LI?"
# Choiceseb "How shall I play this?"
# -Look Rafi/Lily up and down flirtily
# You allow your gaze to drift over to Rafi/Lily.
# It's a gorgeous view.
# And Rafi/Lily has definitely noticed you watching.
# R/L: Night, babe.

# -Turn away
# You shrug and focus on hanging up your face cloth.
# By the time you look back at the mirror, Rafi/Lily has gone.

# -Pull a silly face
# You make the most comical face you can, and Rafi/Lily starts laughing.
# R/L: I can't handle it!
# R/L: You crack me up, MC.
# R/L: See you in the morning.

# LI busies himself/herself with putting away [his_her] toothpaste.
# [he_she] kisses your cheek before heading into the bedroom.
# thought "This was a long day..."
# thought "I need to get ready for bed!"
# thought "I should pick something really gorgeous to wear tonight."
# thought "Especially considering how Lily's been grafting on LI today. I don't want [his_her] head to be turned..."
# Outfit change to sleepwear
# You admire yourself in the mirror.
# thought "Looking like an absolute babe tonight!"
# thought "Let's go with this tonight."
# thought "And now it's got to be time for bed. I'm exhausted!"

# When you return to the bedroom, the Islanders are conked out in bed.
# thought "All that fishing really tired everyone out. (if you didn't pick the gem choice)"
# thought "All that sliding really tired everyone out."
# You slide under the covers beside LI, who murmurs and opens [his_her] eyes sleepily.
# Liona "Mmm, good to see you."
# Liona "You look amazing."
# Liona "I mean, you always do. (you get 🤩 with LI)"
# Liona "But looking like that, you're amazing-amazing."
# Liona "My feet are freezing."
# Liona "Can I warm them up on you? Please?"
# Choiceseb "LI wants to warm up [his_her] feet on me..."
# -Warm up [his_her] feet
# You put your feet next to LI's, and [he_she] snuggles up to you.
# s3_mc "You're freezing!"
# Liona "I warned you!"
# Liona "How are you so warm after that splashing?"
# s3_mc "I run hot, babe."

# -Keep out of range
# s3_mc "Oh no you don't."
# s3_mc "I'm not sharing these warm feet with anyone right now."
# Liona "Aww..."
# Despite [his_her] pitiful tone, [he_she] can't stifle [his_her] laughter.

# -Put your cold hands on [his_her] back
# You allow LI to snuggle up close to you.
# [he_she] gives a contented sigh.
# Then you strike.
# s3_mc "Icy hands on the back!"
# Liona "Aaah!"

# L/R: Urgh...
# L/R: Is it this loud every night?
# B/camilo "Only when Seb's snoring."
# Liona "Sorry! We'll keep it down."
# [he_she] whispers to you.
# Liona "I don't know if I'll ever get used to being in this bed with you..."
# Liona "But I do know that it feels amazing."
# Liona "I'm looking forward to you being the first thing I see tomorrow."

# "Next up... on Love Island!"
# "Could there be a storm brewing?"
# L/R: There. It really helps ease any... tension.
# L/R: I was just helping LI with some moves.
# "Do you brew a storm like you brew the perfect cuppa?"
# "Nah, storms probably have a lot fewer than five sugars."
# "Rafi/Lily has something to confess..."
# R/L: I was hoping I'd run into you, and here you are running into me.
# s3_mc "I need to let Rafi/Lily know how I feel about him!"
# "But the real question is, how funny have I been today?"
# "Sorry... I'll stop fishing for compliments."

# "And now we return to the wild, untamed habitat..."
# "...that is Love Island!"
# "Yesterday we did some serious fishing for compliments!"
# R/L: Welcome, welcome! You are here to play...
# L/R: Hook A Secret!
# "We saw thrills and spills as secrets were revealed..."
# s3_mc "Could LI think Lily/Rafi is the hottest person in the Villa?"
# "And MC answered a delicious question..."
# s3_mc "Rafi's/Lily's friends say Rafi/Lily wants to see an Islanders covered in chocolate. But who?"
# s3_mc "Me."
# R/L: That is correct.
# s3_mc "The Narrator."
# "I will cherish that moment forever."
# R/L: The answer's MC.
# "Oh Rafi/Lily, can't you let me have this one?"
# "And MC was victorious!"
# "And now the Islanders are in their familiar habitat, we can observe their natural behaviour in action!"
# "Rafi shows off his yoga moves in a clear territorial display..."
# s3_mc "He's ridiculously flexible..."
# "While some of our Islanders find it hard to adapt to the new environment..."
# elladine "It's strange... Everything's changing again. I can't get used to it."
# "And MC walks in on... well, I can only call it courtship behaviour..."
# s3_mc "LI!"
# s3_mc "Are you and Lily/Rafi holding hands?"
# "Let's see what's afoot in the wilderness today!"

# You wake to hear murmured voices, then stifled laughter. The other half of your bed is empty.
# thought "Where did LI go?"
# thought "Are people hanging out without me?"
# LI and Lily are over by the window, watching Rafi demonstrate a one-legged yoga pose.
# R: It's called the Dancer. Marvellous for balance and posture.
# s3_mc "He's ridiculously flexible..."
# L: You do it, LI. Try and beat him.
# Y/aj "I don't think yoga's a competition."
# B/H/Cam/T/ciaran "It's on."
# LI slowly stretches into the same pose, a little wobbly.
# Lily/Rafi rests a hand on the small of [his_her] back to stabilise [him_her] as LI breathes into the stretch.
# L/R: There. It really helps ease any... tension.
# Rafi/Lily sees you watching, and flashes a brilliant smile.
# R/L: I hope we didn't disturb you. You looked so peaceful, I didn't want to wake you up.
# R/L: Especially when you look as good as you do this morning.
# R/L: Like, it should honestly be a crime.
# Liona "We're definitely in agreement there."
# R/L: Not that you needed your beauty sleep at all. You manage to make anything look good. Even morning bedhead.
# L/R: I was just helping LI with some moves.
# LI returns both feet to the ground, looking flustered.
# Liona "Yoga! They are for yoga... the moves."
# R/L: Yes, 'yoga moves'. That's what we're calling it these days.
# Choiceseb "Was Lily/Rafi helping with yoga moves...or something else?"
# -Wake me up next time
# s3_mc "I want to do some yoga next time."
# Lily/Rafi shrugs, looking entirely unruffled.
# L/R: I'm sure Rafi/Lily would love to give you a hand with the balance poses.
# L: Since he's such an expert.
# R: Since she's been observing so well.

# -I'd like to see Rafi's/Lily's moves
# s3_mc "Next time wake me up."
# s3_mc "I'd be sad to miss Rafi's moves."
# R: Oh, I can always give you a private class another time.
# s3_mc "I bet Lily's got some good moves, too."
# L: Oh, trust me, I do.
# [his_her] gaze flickers to LI as though he's/she's concerned that he's/she's spotted you flirting.
# LI is busy chatting with Lily/Rafi, and doesn't seem to have noticed anything.

# -Stop grafting on LI
# s3_mc "Did you get up just so you could graft on LI?"
# L: I heard Rafi doing his stretches and had to see what was going on.
# R: I need my morning stretches as much as anyone.

# Rafi nudges Lily with an elbow.
# Lily jabs Rafi with an elbow.
# R: Come on, babe. Let's be hospitable and get some tea for the others.
# L: Come on, doll, stop standing around.
# L: I'm desperate for a cup of tea, and we can grab enough for everyone.
# Lily/Rafi gives LI a yearning glance, but strolls out to the kitchen with Rafi/Lily anyway.
# Everyone else is still asleep. LI returns to your bed, and puts an arm around your shoulders.
# ciaran "Rafi seems... nice."
# ciaran "It's a bit weird having new people around here."
# B/H/Cam/AJ/T/yasmin "Lily's/Rafi's settling in nicely."
# B/H/Cam/AJ/T/yasmin "It's good to see new faces around the Villa."
# Liona "What do you think of them both?"
# Choiceseb "LI's wondering what I think about Rafi and Lily..."
# -They're both so hot
# s3_mc "I can't believe we're surrounded by so many gorgeous people."
# Liona "I know, right?"
# Liona "Raif's literally a model, and Lily could wear a bin bag and make it look amazing."

# -They're too full on
# s3_mc "They walked like they owned the place."
# s3_mc "I don't know who they think they are."
# Liona "I suppose when you're that hot, you can do whoever you like."
# Liona "Whatever you like. Whatever you like!"

# -They're nothing compared to you
# s3_mc "We may be surrounded by gorgeous people..."
# s3_mc "But they're nothing compared to you."
# LI smiles and kisses your cheek.
# Liona "You're the sweetest."

# Elladine bounces out of bed and starts pulling the duvet off Nicky.
# elladine "Get up, sleepyhead!"
# Nicky groans and tries to cocoon himself in the duvet, but Elladine holds firm.
# elladine "OK, OK."
# nicky "As long as you give me some of your tea."

# L: He can handle himself.
# L: I'm not much of a kitchen type.

# The perfume is deep and moody, with a swirl of musk to it.
# L: What do you think of my perfume?
# Choiceseb "Do I like Lily's perfume...?"

# Instead he's/she's engrossed in Lily/Rafi talking about exercises.

# -My glutes
# s3_mc "My glutes are exceptional."
# s3_mc "Exceptionally strong, of course."
# (telling Rafi/Lily earlier you're not interested):
# Liona "Oh, I know that. (you get 😍 with LI)"
# [he_she] nudges you affectionately.
# (telling Rafi/Lily earlier you're interested):
# Rafi/Lily raises an eyebrow.
# R/L: Naturally. Oh, you were talking strength?
# s3_mc "This isn't just for show. I can get right down to the floor when I squat."
# R/L: Oh, I've noticed. (you get 😍 with Rafi/Lily)
# LI doesn't seem to notice the spark of heat in Rafi's/Lily's gaze.
# Instead he's/she's engrossed in Lily/Rafi talking about exercises.

# s3_mc "My brain's my strongest muscle."
# (telling Rafi/Lily earlier you're not interested):

# [he_she] nudges you affectionately.
# s3_mc "And I exercise it as much as I can."

# Liona "Lily's/Rafi's thumbs are really strong."
# L/R: I've never heard that one before.
# L/R: But I'm the reigning champion, so it must be true.
# R/L: Since when is everyone worried about thumb strength?
# L/R: Well, it says something about your... manual dexterity.
# (Rafi grafting LI):
# Rafi gives Yasmin/AJ a smouldering look.
# R: Ah... you've got an eyelash on your cheek. Perfect to show the manual dexterity in action...
# Rafi reaches around you to lightly, deliberately, touch Yasmin's/AJ's cheek.
# R: Got it.
# (Lily grafting LI):
# Lily gives LI a smouldering look and reaches around you to lay a light, but deliberate hand on [his_her] leg.
# And then squeezes.
# L/R: You see?
# LI's eyes are wide.
# Liona "Yeah. Yeah... I see what you mean."
# thought "I don't. I don't see what Lily/Rafi means at all! Is LI actually into this?"
# thought "I can't believe Lily/Rafi keeps grafting LI while I'm right here!"
# thought "I'm going to have to take matters into my own hands. Get everyone's attention back on me."
# Choiceseb "I have to challenge Lily/Rafi to a thumb wrestling match."
# -I'll give it all I've got (gem choice)
# -I'd rather not
# Lily/Rafi is murmuring something that everyone finds tremendously funny. But you can't hear.
# LI laughs along with the others, relaxed and happy.
# thought "If I take action now, it'll put me in a better position later."
# Choiceseb "Shall I challenge Lily/Rafi?"
# -Let's do this (gem choice)
# -I'd rather just chill out
# You sit back and watch LI and Harry start another round of thumb-wrestling.
# BFF shoots you a knowing look, but doesn't say anything.
# Lily/Rafi wins by a mile, but LI doesn't seem to mind.
# Even in the gorgeous sunshine, it's hard to relax with them chatting away.
# It's a relief when...

# Gem choicelladine ""
# s3_mc "Right, Lily/Rafi, it's on."
# L/R: Excuse me?
# s3_mc "You may be the reigning champion, but there's a new fighter in town."
# L/R: You?
# s3_mc "Me."
# bff "Go MC. You can do it."
# Liona "Of course you can."
# Liona "Why do you suddenly care about thumb wrestling, babe?"
# Choiceseb "I care about thumb wrestling... (no further reaction)"
# -...for my own honour
# -...to show LI how great I am
# -...to show off to Lily/Rafi
# -...to show Lily/Rafi who's boss

# s3_mc "It's time."
# Lily/Rafi holds out a hand. You grip tightly.
# genevieve "Three..."
# Lily/Rafi mutters under her/her breath.
# L/R: This isn't going to do you any favours, hun.
# genevieve "Two..."
# L/R: If you think LI can be stolen, maybe you're not so secure in your relationship.
# genevieve "One..."
# thought "I have to win this."
# Choiceseb "Shall I play fair or win another way?"
# -Distract Lily/Rafi
# -Play fair
# You breathe deeply. Centre yourself. Focus.
# bff "Go!"

# -Intimidate Lily/Rafi
# You meet Lily's/Rafi's gaze, and pull a fearsome scowl.
# s3_mc "This Villa ain't big enough for both of us, babe."
# L/R: Well... I...
# bff "Go!"
# L/R: Hey, that's not fair! I wasn't ready.
# s3_mc "All's fair in love and war."

# You push your thumb against Lily's/Rafi's. She has a strong grip, and for a moment you're not sure if you'll overpower her...
# But then an image surfaces in your mind.
# (if you chose “to show Lily/Rafi who's boss”):
# You, standing sad and alone, while Lily/Rafi is surrounded with applause and cheering.
# thought "If I can't even win this, how can I show Lily/Rafi who's in charge?"
# (if you chose “for my own honour”):
# You, surrounded with applause and cheering, and the flash of cameras.
# thought "If I can't even win this, how can I win Love Island?"
# (if you chose “to show LI how great I am”):
# You and LI, your arms linked. LI kisses your cheek.
# thought "If I can't even win this, how can I keep LI's heart?"

# You push yourself to the max. And finally, finally...
# L/R: OK, OK, you win.
# L/R: You're the new reigning champion.
# Liona "You're the best, MC! (you get 😍 with LI)"
# Around you, the other Islanders whoop and cheer.
# Surrounded with congratulations and warmth from your friends and LI, you bask happily in the sunshine.
# thought "That was amazing."
# (if you chose “to show Lily/Rafi who's boss”):
# Lily/Rafi looks away, dejected.
# L/R: Well, yeah. Congratulations to MC.
# (if you chose “for my own honour”):
# BFF claps you on the back.
# bff "Nice work, MC. You're the Villa champion!"
# thought "I can't believe I'm the official champion!"
# (if you chose “to show LI how great I am”):
# Li puts an arm around your shoulders and squeezes you affectionately.
# Liona "I still don't exactly know why you cared so much..."
# Liona "But it feels great to be coupled up with a champion!"

# thought "It's me!"
# s3_mc "I got a text!"
# text "MC, put on your most gorgeous outfit and strut your stuff! #timeforadate"

# Liona "Wait, is that me?"
# LI reads out the text.

# -I'm gonna shine like a star
# thought "Fresh air, sunshine, good food, good company..."
# thought "I want to feel my best when I'm on this picnic!"

# -I have to outshine Lily/Rafi

# "The courtship displays begin..."
# R/L: Welcome, mi amor. You are looking beautiful, as always.

# "Ah, smell that? That's right."
# "It's the countryside."
# "A fresh meadow, the salty sea air, and a cool breeze. What could be better for a nice romantic date."
# "It certainly smells better than the countryside back in the UK, that's for sure."
# "I can tell you from experience that a romantic picnic does not go well with an angry farmer."
# "...or the heady aroma of fertiliser."
# "Lucky Rafi/Lily didn't have to worry about any of that when [he_she] invited MC on a date."
# s3_mc "I'm flattered you picked me."
# R/L: I do think I've got a lot to offer. I wouldn't be here otherwise.
# "It seems like love is in the air, folks!"
# "Or... wait a minute, no, that's just the smell of Rafi's aftershave/Lily's perfume."
# "He's/She's going to have to let me borrow that after the show..."

# You approach the picnic area to see all sorts of food laid out for you.
# There's pastries, yoghurts, jams, and fruit in various neat piles across the table. A bottle of wine cools in a bucket of ice.
# You see Rafi/Lily waiting for you, a wide grin on [his_her] face.
# Choiceseb "Rafi/Lily looks..."
# -...stunning
# thought "He's/She's a bit of me, alright."

# -...like he's/she's trying too hard
# thought "I know he's/she's into me, but there's no need to be so full on."

# -...not as good as LI
# thought "Doesn't matter how hard [he_she] tries, he's not gonna replace LI."

# Rafi/Lily sees you studying [him_her].
# R/L: Welcome, mi amor. You are looking beautiful, as always.
# R/L: And that outfit is amazing! You're better dressed than me!(you get 😍 with Rafi/Lily)
# s3_mc "Thank you. You don't look half bad yourself."
# R/L: You could make anything look good. And that's saying something. (you get 😍 with Rafi/Lily)
# As you go to sit down, [he_she] rushes over to move the chair out for you.
# R/L: Let me get that for you.
# s3_mc "Thank you."
# Rafi/Lily pushes your chair in as you sit down.
# Then [he_she] moves around the table and pours a glass of wine for each of you before sitting down.
# R/L: I hope I'm not intruding on your relationship by picking you for the date.
# R/L: I had to pick someone, at the end of the day. And you're the most interesting person in this Villa by far.
# Choiceseb "Is Rafi/Lily intruding on my relationship?"
# -I wish you'd picked someone else
# s3_mc "Sorry, I don't mean that in a bad way. I'm just very comfortable in my relationship right now. (you get 🙁 with Rafi/Lily)"
# s3_mc "I don't need complications like that."
# R/L: I see. Totally understandable.

# -I'm glad you picked me
# R/L: Well I'm very glad I picked you. I had a feeling there was potential there. (you get 😍 with Rafi/Lily)

# -It's just part of Love Island
# R/L: Absolutely. This is what it's all about, right?
# s3_mc "Right! It's called Love Island not Friend Island."

# R/L: And I wanna make one thing clear.
# R/L: I'm a confident guy/woman. I see what I want and I go for it. Right now, that's you.
# R/L: But if by the end of this date you tell me you're not into me, I'll take that on the chin and move on, no questions asked.
# R/L: Fair?
# s3_mc "Fair."
# R/L: Alright, great! Let's just enjoy ourselves for a bit, shall we? Talk about something other than the Villa.
# s3_mc "Sounds fine to me."
# R/L: Well, I know a lot about you from the telly. I'm always happy to ask more...
# R/L: ...but maybe you want to ask me something? There's still plenty you don't know about me.
# Choiceseb "What should we talk about? (you can choose all; after choosing “shall we move on?” the next batch of questions appear and there is no turning back to the previous questions)"
# -Let's talk work
# -Let's talk animals
# -Let's talk niche obsessions
# -Shall we move on? (appears after talking about the first theme)

# Work:
# s3_mc "Let's talk about work."
# R/L: Yours or mine?
# s3_mc "Both. Either."
# R/L: Alright. So you're a scientist/model/pro athlete/musician, yeah?
# s3_mc "Yup!"
# R/L: I've gotta say, it's always a treat when someone has both the beauty and the brains. (you get 😍 with Rafi/Lily)
# R/L: I think being a scientist is one of those jobs that so many people would love to have... it sounds so cool...
# s3_mc "Really?"
# R/L: Defo. Just because I'm not sciency doesn't mean I can't appreciate it.
# s3_mc "True."
# R/L: I reckon that's part of why Harry likes you so much, too! He's well into someone with brains. Everyone can tell.
# s3_mc "You mean people watching at home?"
# R/L: Yeah. Everyone was rooting for you guys at the last recoupling.
# s3_mc "Oh, wow."
# R/L: Yeah, I wasn't surprised at all to hear that. I know I said it already but you are absolutely stunning. (you get 😍 with Rafi/Lily)
# R/L: Even more so in person, if I can say that.
# R: And you can trust me to tell the truth. I know a thing or two about modelling, after all.
# s3_mc "Thanks. I do my best."
# R/L: Not that he's shallow or anything, but that's definitely a big reason Bill/Ciaran/Camilo is into you.
# R/L: Everyone at home can see he wants to go for the most attractive girls.
# s3_mc "Really?"
# R/L: Yeah. It's a good thing you're the most attractive girl in here.
# R/L: I absolutely love an artistic girl. (you get 😍 with Rafi/Lily)
# R/L: There's nothing more attractive than someone who is in touch with their feelings and can express themselves through art.
# s3_mc "If you say so..."
# R: Maybe that's just me.
# R/L: It makes totally sense that Yasmin is into you as well. You guys are a super popular couple on TV.
# s3_mc "Really?"
# R/L: Absolutely!
# R/L: It definitely shows. I absolutely love a girl who works out.(you get 😍 with Rafi/LIly)
# R/L: Strong woman are 100% my weakness. Got no qualms about admitting that.
# s3_mc "Good to know."
# R/L: And I can totally see why AJ/Tai is into you. You guys are like the sporty power couple, right?
# s3_mc "I guess you could say that."
# R/L: Do you enjoy it, then?
# s3_mc "My job?"
# R/L: Yeah. Like, what's a typical day for you?
# Choiceseb "What's my average day as a scientist/model/pro athlete/musician like?"
# -Stressful
# s3_mc "It's hard work. Maybe harder than people think."
# R/L: Just makes me respect you even more. I love a girl who takes her craft seriously.

# -So-so
# s3_mc "Like, it's probably not where I want to end up eventually. But it pays the bills."
# R/L: Yeah, I know exactly what that's like.
# R/L: Now that you've been on Love Island, though, I'm sure you'll have new opportunities when you get out.
# R/L: You're definitely a hit on the outside.
# s3_mc "I am?"
# R/L: Mhm. Try not to let it get to your head or anything, though. I know I probably would.

# -Like a dream come true
# R/L: That's awesome. It's always good to meet someone who's really passionate about what they do.
# R/L: Too many people get stuck in the motions so easily, and never dare to go for what they really want.

# s3_mc "Alright, then... So you're a..."
# (Lily grafting MC):
# L: Just a student for now. Nothing special.
# s3_mc "Industrial Design, though. That's nothing to scoff at. (if you chose the gem option to get to know her better)"
# (if you didn't choose the gem option to get to know her better):
# s3_mc "What are you studying?"
# L: Industrial Design.
# s3_mc "Sounds intense."
# L: It's easy. Honestly. I sort of fell into it, but I'm glad I did because now it feels like I was made for it.
# L: I guess Design Technology was always a favourite subject at school, as well. Not many people can say that, can they?
# (Rafi grafting MC):
# R: ...An actor.
# s3_mc "Not just an actor. If I remember correctly. (if you chose the gem option to get to know him better)"
# R: Well, actor-singer-dancer-model. But I try not to do them all at once.
# s3_mc "Someone's humble."
# R/L: Just being honest.
# R/L: Really, though. It's nothing special. I'm just getting started after all.
# R/L: But it's something I want to do. And that means a lot.
# R/L: Not to sound like a cheap fortune cookie or anything, but you gotta follow your dreams, right?
# s3_mc "Can't argue with that."

# Animals:
# s3_mc "Can we talk about pets?"
# R/L: Moving that fast already, are we?
# s3_mc "No! Just wanted to know what you thought about them."
# R/L: Truthfully... I've never had any. But I'm open to the idea in the future.
# (Lily grafting MC):
# L: Just... no farmyard animals, please.
# s3_mc "Huh?"
# L: It's a... uh, a long story.
# R/L: Why do you ask? Are you a pet person?
# Choiceseb "Am I a pet person?"
# -The biggest there is
# s3_mc "If you wanna date me, my pets come as part of the package, I'm afraid!"
# R/L: I suppose I can live with that.
# R/L: Who knows? Maybe I'll find out I'm a pet person after all.

# -Nope, not me!
# R/L: Well, I guess that settles that!
# R/L: No pets on the table, for now, then. I can live with that.

# -I want to have one or two, for sure
# R/L: I suppose I can live with that.
# R/L: Who knows? Maybe I'll find out I'm a pet person after all.

# niche obsessions:
# s3_mc "Go ahead, don't be shy. Everyone has one."
# R/L: Ooh, OK. That's an interesting question...
# (Lily grafting MC):
# L: Obviously, cars are my big passion.
# L: But I'm not sure that counts as 'quirky'.
# L: Tell you what, I am absolutely obsessed with this drink they do in one of my favourite bars back home.
# L: They call it 'The Remedy', right, but it's so simple. You can make it at home.
# L: Coconut rum and chocolate milk. That's all it is.
# L: But I can't get enough of it. Now I miss it so bad, I haven't been able to have one since flying out here.
# Choiceseb "That sounds..."
# -...kinda boring
# -...amazing!
# L: Believe me, it is. You should try it.

# -...awful
# L: Don't knock it till you've tried it.

# L: I'll make one for you sometime, if we get the chance.
# L: Anyway... that's my weird obsession, I guess.
# (Rafi grafting MC):
# R: Can I say baklava?
# s3_mc "No way! Come on dig deep, there must be something."
# R: There is this band I love called... actually, their name is NSFD...
# s3_mc "Huh?"
# R: Not Safe For Dates!...they have a bit of a rude name. It's a heavy metal band.
# R: I used to be a bit of an angsty teen, actually. The band helped. Guess that's why they're so important to me.
# R: But they're definitely niche. Tiny following, hardly ever leave their home country, you know?
# Choiceseb "Rafi's niche obsession is a metal band..."
# -I hate that kinda music
# s3_mc "Sorry, but it's just a load of shouting and noise. Don't understand anyone can enjoy it."
# R: Hey, there's a lot more to it than that. (you get 🙁 with Rafi)
# R: You've just gotta spend some time getting to know the genre, and appreciate it for what it is.
# R: Like I said, I don't even listen to it anymore, but you shouldn't judge people who do.
# R: Anyway... that's my weird obsession, I guess.

# -That's really sweet
# R: Thanks. I don't tell many people about that. But I had a feeling you'd be the understanding type.
# R: Anyway... that's my weird obsession, I guess.

# -I love metal, I bet I know the band
# R: Really now? It is quite obscure, you know.
# s3_mc "Try me."
# R: Alright, they're called... hang og...
# Rafi leans over the table and whispers in your ear...
# s3_mc "Why are you whispering? There's no one here."
# R: Um. I'd rather not say it out loud.
# Rafi whispers something in your ear. It contains multiple profanities.
# s3_mc "Ok then..."
# Choiceseb "Have I heard of Rafi's favourite band?"
# -Ugh, that band is the worst
# -I haven't heard of them
# R: No worries. I've never met anyone who has, except at their shows.
# R: It's nice to talk about it, though. Not like you meet many people in the modelling industry who know anything about it.
# s3_mc "Right?! (MC's job is model)"
# R: Exactly, you know what I mean! (MC's job is model)
# R: Anyway... that's my weird obsession, I guess.

# -Yup! I love them!
# s3_mc "Wow! I've never met anyone who knew who they were before!"
# R: Wow! You just keep getting better and better, MC. (you get 😍 with Rafi)
# R: What did you think of their latest album?
# s3_mc "Well, I..."
# R: Personally, I think it was their best yet, but a lot of people seem to hate it.
# s3_mc "I think that..."
# R: Which I don't get at all. Just because band experiments doesn't mean that they've suddenly betrayed the fans or something.
# Rafi catches himself.
# R: Ha! Sorry. I get a bit carried away when I talk about them. Don't get to do that often.
# A moments later, his excitement calms down, and Rafi's cool and collected demeanour returns.
# R: My bad.
# Choiceseb "What do I think of the band's latest album?"
# -It wasn't for me
# -I liked it!
# R: Thank you!
# R: So glad you said that. Nobody appreciates experimentations these days, I swear.
# R: It's nice to talk about it, though. Not like you meet many people in the modelling industry who know anything about it.
# s3_mc "Right?! (MC's job is model)"
# R: Exactly, you know what I mean! (MC's job is model)
# R: Anyway... that's my weird obsession, I guess.


# Shall we move on?:
# R/L: Totally.
# Choiceseb "Time is getting a bit, but we've probably got time for a few more serious questions...  (you can choose all; after choosing “I reckon that's enough grilling for today” there is no turning back to the previous questions)"

# -What's your ideal partner?
# -If you could have anyone from history as your dinner guest...
# -Why are you on Love Island?
# -I reckon that's enough grilling for today (appears after talking about the first theme)

# Ideal partner:
# s3_mc "Alright then. Who's your ideal partner?"
# R/L: Ooh, a tough question. Love it.
# R/L: You mean, besides you, right?
# s3_mc "I mean it. I want to know!"
# R/L: Well, my ideal partner's proper fit, obviously. And full of confidence. But then everyone says that.
# (Lily grafting MC):
# L: I think she's a girl, for sure. And she likes to mess around with me. Have a bit of fun.
# L: She doesn't take herself too seriously. She knows what she wants, and there's no nonsense about it.
# L. It's gotta be stress-free. Good vibes only, you know?
# (Rafi grafting MC):
# R: My ideal girl is compassionate. For sure. She's the selfless one that's always looking out for other people.
# R: She's the kinda girl who wouldn't hesitate to give to charity. She always knows what to get you for a birthday.
# R: But she's not shy or sheepish, mind you. She still knows what's important to her and works to get it.
# s3_mc "So you haven't given it much thought then!"
# R: I know, I know... It is a bit specific.
# s3_mc "Just a tad."
# R: I guess I think about it a lot because I'm ready for a real relationship.
# R: I just... I'd love to be with someone who can match my ambition and energy.
# Choiceseb "What do I think of Rafi's/Lily's ideal partner?"
# -That sounds just like me!
# s3_mc "Like, maybe not one hundred percent the same. But I'd say that fits me pretty well."
# R/L: Well, I did say I was good at knowing what I want, didn't I? (you get 😏 with Rafi/Lily)
# R/L: There's a reason I picked you for this date, babe. I think you'd be perfect for me. But only if you want it, too.

# -I don't think I'm what you're looking for
# s3_mc "Sorry, I think you must have just misunderstood me. I don't think I fit the bill."
# R/L: I guess... (you get 🙁 and 😲 with Rafi/Lily)
# R/L: I'm definitely attracted to you, though, so maybe my 'ideal partner' isn't as ideal as I thought.
# R/L: I'm definitely up for expanding my horizons...

# -I think you're asking too much
# R/L: Maybe you're right. But you did say 'ideal partner'.
# R/L: I know that finding someone who lives up to the image in my head isn't realistic, don't worry.
# R/L: I'd say you come pretty close, though.
# R/L: Am I wrong?
# Choiceseb "Am I the right fit for Rafi/Lily?"
# -I think so
# s3_mc "Like, maybe not one hundred perfect the same. But I'd say that fits me pretty well."
# R/L: Well, I did say I was good at knowing what I want, didn't I? (you get 😏 with Rafi/Lily)
# R/L: There's a reason I picked you for this date, babe. I think you'd be perfect for me. But only if you want it, too.

# -Nope
# s3_mc "Sorry, I think you must have just misunderstood me. I don't think I fit the bill."
# R/L: I guess... (you get 🙁 and 😲 with Rafi/Lily)
# R/L: I'm definitely attracted to you, though, so maybe my 'ideal partner' isn't as ideal as I thought.
# R/L: I'm definitely up for expanding my horizons...

# R/L: Your turn.
# R/L: Tell me about your ideal partner, and don't hold back.
# Choiceseb "My ideal partner..."
# -...is you 
# R/L: Well. (you get 😍 with Rafi/Lily)
# R/L: I'll try not to let that affect my ego too much, shall I?
# R/L: I knew we were a good fit.

# -...is a boy who...(no further reaction)

# -...is a girl who... 
# L: I knew it. (you get 😍 with Lily)

# L: Sorry. Carry on.

# (different reactions for Rafi depending on the pairing): 
# R: Wow! Not to be too presumptuous or anything, but that sure sounds a lot like me! (you get 😍 with Rafi)
# R: And I'm not just saying it. Those are all things I find important.

# -knows what they want+doesn't make a fuss+laugh+kindness
# R: Makes sense. I think I've got a few of those features, for sure. (you get 😍 with Rafi)

# Dinner guest:
# s3_mc "...who would it be?"
# (Lily grafting MC):
# L: That's a tough one...
# L: What about Amelia Earhart? I'd just want to know what happened to her!
# L: Then I'd ask other stuff, obviously. Like, 'What on Earth inspired you to try and fly around the world?'
# L: She'd be my kinda woman, I reckon. Probably mechanically-minded, too!
# s3_mc "I get you."
# (Rafi grafting MC):
# R: Hmm. I've never thought about that before.
# R: That's tough. I'm not hugely into history, but...
# R: I bet it would be interesting to go really far back. Talk to someone with a completely different worldview than mine.
# R: I'm talking like, a Roman Emperor or an Egyptian Pharaoh. Just to see what they think of the world and where it's going.
# R: Or even better, talk to a random peasant at the time. That could be even more telling.
# R: 'Excuse me sir, can you tell me what shape the Earth is?'
# R: Exactly. I'd ask 'em what they thought of their king, or what the greatest city in the world is. Could be fun!
# s3_mc "I get you."
# R/L: What about you? Have you got someone?
# Choiceseb "Who would I want to meet from history? (no further reaction)"
# -Marie Curie
# -Rosa Parks
# -Cleopatra
# -Jane Austen

# R/L: Ah, that's a good one. Much better than mine.
# R/L: You've clearly answered this question before.
# R/L: I bet it would be interesting to see what she thinks about the world today. How much it's changed.

# Why are you on Love Island?:
# s3_mc "Come on, be straight with me."
# Lily raises her eyebrow and gives you a wry smile.
# s3_mc "You know what I mean."
# s3_mc "What's your reason for being here? Truthfully."
# R/L: That one's easy.
# (Lily grafting MC):
# L: Truthfully? I came on here because I thought it would be a damn good time. I wanted to have a dream summer.
# L: I'm not expecting to find the love of my life, necessarily, but it can't hurt to try, can it?
# L: I think a few people round here put a bit too much stock into finding someone and then settling down.
# L: Stuff moves fast, and the relationships that are formed in here rarely last.
# L: So I'm just here to kick back and have fun, and if I get a great relationship out of it when I get back, that's just a bonus.
# (Rafi grafting MC):
# R: I thought it would be something I can do for the hell of it. I might meet a beautiful girl and fall for her, I might not.
# R: Mostly, it'll be a really fun and unique experience that I can tell my family and mates about.
# R: And if I win, I already know what I'm gonna spend the money on.
# s3_mc "Oh?"
# R: My brother has always wanted to go on a long haul trip to Tokyo.
# R: He's mad about anime. Travel just isn't designed for people in wheelchairs and it's so expensive to curate a trip that will be accessible and fun for him.
# R: So that's my priority really. Mobility aids are ridiculously expensive.
# R: And we'll see about the rest. Maybe I can put a deposit down for a flat? Who knows.
# R/L: And hey, if all else fails, it'll probably do wonders for my brand, right?
# s3_mc "Good to see you've got your priorities straight."
# R/L: What about you, why are you here? Not sure I remember you ever talking about it.
# Choiceseb "Why did I come on Love Island?"
# -To get down and dirty and have a good time
# s3_mc "What's Love Island without a bit of fun? It's not Friendship Island at the end of the day. (you get 😍 with Rafi/Lily)"
# R/L: I can definitely relate to that. (you get 😍 with Rafi/Lily)
# R/L: Especially as I'm not gonna be in here for all that long, whatever happens.
# R/L: Then again, that's not to say I'd pass up the opportunity to be with someone I seriously liked, if they came my way.

# -To make friends and just have a nice holiday
# R/L: Nice. Totally relatable. Why get too wrapped up in it when you can just kick back and enjoy yourself. (you get 😍 with Rafi/Lily)
# R/L: If that's all you get out of it, it's just water off a duck's back.
# R/L: But if you do find someone you like, that's just icing on the cake, isn't it?

# -To find 'the one'
# R/L: Wow, that's some commitment.
# R/L: I'm not saying I wouldn't take a chance if I fell for someone like that.
# R/L: But when you're in here for as short a time as I am, well... I wasn't counting on it, I guess.
# R/L: Never say never, though, right?

# Rafi's/Lily's words hang in the air for a moment. There's a short pause.

# I reckon that's enough grilling for today:
# R/L: Sure.
# The sun is starting to hang lower in the sky. You realise that your wine is empty.
# R/L: I'm really enjoying this, though.
# R/L: I mean, obviously. It goes without saying. But you're even more fun to talk to in real life.
# R/L: I'll be honest. I was pretty cynical coming in here. Never had that much luck in love.
# R/L: But you're really something, MC.
# thought "Rafi/Lily is clearly coming on to me here."
# Choiceseb "I wonder if I should make it clear where we stand? Before it goes any further..."
# -I'm not really feeling it
# s3_mc "Listen... Rafi/Lily..."
# Choiceseb "How do I say this?"
# -You're way too full-on
# -You're just not for me
# s3_mc "Sorry. But I can tell it wouldn't work. Nothing against you, that's just how I feel."
# R/L: Fair, fair.
# R/L: And thanks for being honest. That means a lot.

# -I'm too loyal, babes
# s3_mc "I'm proud of being loyal. I wouldn't do that to LI, it just doesn't feel right."
# R/L: Right. I can respect that. And I wouldn't wanna be the one to break up one of the strongest couples in the Villa.

# -I'm in love with LI
# R/L: Wow, really?
# s3_mc "Um. Yeah. And there's nothing you could do that would change that now. Sorry."
# R/L: Well, OK. I can't argue with that.

# R/L: Alright. I'll leave it there then. No sense trying to push something that obviously isn't gonna work.
# R/L: You're a really great girl, MC. LI's lucky to have you.
# R/L: In fact... I should give you a heads-up there.
# s3_mc "What do you mean?"
# R/L: I'm talking about Lily/Rafi.
# R/L: I might be stepping on some toes here, but I gotta ask.
# R/L: You and LI, are you solid?
# Choiceseb "How solid is my relationship with LI?"
# -A little bit shaky, if I'm honest
# -Like a rock
# s3_mc "LI means a lot to me, and we get on really well. I think [he_she] feels the same. I trust [him_her], definitely."
# R/L: That's good. Honestly, I mean that.

# -It's still early days, but I'm hopeful
# s3_mc "None of us have been here that long so it's hard to say anything with much confidence."
# s3_mc "But I'm still really enjoying my time with LI. I think we can make it to the end."
# R/L: Yeah, that's fair.

# R/L: I only asked because I know that  Lily/Rafi is grafting hard. You must've seen it too.
# R/L: I've had words. She's/He's definitely confident about her/his chances.
# R/L: Just want you to have all the info, I guess. Watch out for her/him. She's/He's gonna want to couple up at some point too, remember.
# Choiceseb "Rafi thinks I should watch out for Lily/Rafi..."
# -Bring it on!
# s3_mc "If [he_she] wants to play a game, let's do it. May the best one of us win."
# R/L: Ha! I love the attitude. You're proper loyal, LI's well lucky.

# -How could [he_she]?
# s3_mc "I honestly can't believe some people."
# R/L: Well, that's why me and her/him are here. It's Love Island, at the end of the day. Gotta try your best.

# -I trust LI
# s3_mc "I know that [he_she] wouldn't just run off like that. Our relationship means more than that."
# R/L: That's good to hear, you guys are definitely the couple to beat.

# R/L: Anyway, just felt like you should know.
# s3_mc "Thanks, Rafi/Lily. I appreciate it."

# -I'm up for seeing where this goes (exactly the same scene as “Best to keep my options open”)

# -Best to keep my options open
# s3_mc "Thanks, hun. You're sweet."
# Rafi/Lily chuckles.
# R/L: I'm glad you think so.
# R/L: I do think I've got a lot to offer. I wouldn't be here otherwise.
# R/L: Apart from being smart, sexy, and confident, I mean.
# R/L: But seriously...
# R/L: I don't want you to get the wrong impression of me. They threw me in here to stir things up, obviously. But I'm more than that.
# R/L: And I do, like, actually like you. More than I usually like someone after a day, anyway.
# R/L: I really feel like there's a spark between us. I'd... well, I'd like to see it grow.
# Rafi/Lily catches himself/herself for a moment, and laughs nervously.
# R/L: Look at me, getting all sentimental. I'm not usually like this.
# [he_she] leans in slightly, a smile tugging on [his_her] lips.
# R/L: That's what you do to me.
# Choiceseb "Rafi's/Lily's getting awfully close..."
# -Shut [him_her] down
# s3_mc "Listen... Rafi/Lily... (the rest of the scene that follows is the same as choosing “I'm not really feeling it”)"

# -Lean in for a kiss (gem choice)
# You lean forwards. You see the corner of Rafi's/Lily's smile turning upwards ever so slightly.
# You stare into [his_her] eyes for a moment. They're a deep, dazzling green. A dash of orange dusklight is reflected on their surface.
# Your eyes close involuntarily as you sweep in for a kiss. Rafi/Lily leans into you eagerly, [his_her] lips pressing against yours.
# [his_her] left hand reaches across the table to take yours, and your fingers interlace.
# [his_her] right hand comes up to gently cup your cheek, before slowly moving into your hair. [he_she] strokes it tenderly as you kiss.
# Eventually, you pull away. A wide smile is plastered across Rafi's/Lily's face.
# R/L: I'm breathless. (you get 😍 with Rafi/Lily)
# R/L: Good job.
# s3_mc "I aim to please."
# R/L: I'd say the date is going well, then.
# s3_mc "You believe what you want to believe, hun."
# Rafi/Lily grins.

# -Stay where you are
# A silence hangs over the both of you. It doesn't feel awkward, though.
# Rafi/Lily looks at ease. [he_she] stares at you, intently. You can almost see the thoughts running through [his_her] head.
# Choiceseb "This might be my only chance..."
# -Lean in for the kiss (gem choice)
# -Sit back in the chair
# You sit back in your chair. Rafi/Lily relaxes and pulls away slightly.
# The tension slowly starts to dissipate.

# R/L: Guess it's time for me to quit beating around the bush, huh?
# s3_mc "How do you mean?"
# (telling Rafi/Lily earlier you're interested):
# R/L: I don't know one hundred percent what you're thinking, but I think we had a good enough time, right?
# (telling Rafi/Lily earlier you're not interested):
# R/L: Well, it seems like you're not that into me. So I probs shouldn't be dragging this out too much.
# R/L:  I guess I just want to ask you for my own peace of mind, even though I know what the answer will be.
# R/L: At some point there's gonna be one more recoupling. For me and Lily/Rafi, right? Might be the last one.
# R/L: MC...
# R/L: Do you want me to pick you if I ever get the chance?
# thought "Rafi/Lily wants to couple up with me..."
# thought "Lily/Rafi has been grafting on LI, but I haven't had a chance to see where [his_her] head is at."
# thought "Rafi/Lily is clearly into me, [he_she] deserves a clear answer... but do I feel enough to actually ditch LI for [him_her]?"
# Choiceseb "What should I say?"
# -Yes, I'd like to couple up with you
# You see Rafi's/Lily's face light up in delight... and is that...
# ...surprise?
# Rafi clenches his first in triumph. (you get ❤️ with Rafi)
# R: Aw, yeah. Get in.
# He seems to catch himself.
# R: Ha! Sorry. I am well pleased though.
# R I really put all my eggs in your basket to be honest. That could have gone badly. So glad it didn't.
# Lily grins and winks wickedly. (you get ❤️ with Lily)
# L: Knew it. Totally. Was never worried. Not for a second. Nope.
# L: Thanks, hun. It means a lot. You won't regret it.

# -No, I'm sticking with LI
# You see a flicker of disappointment in Rafi's/Lily's eyes. But then it's gone, and he's/she's smiling again.
# R/L: Fair enough. I thought you might say that. (you get 💔 with Rafi/Lily)
# R/L: You're a really great girl, MC. LI's lucky to have you.
# R/L: In fact... I should give you a heads-up there.
# s3_mc "What do you mean?"

# R/L: Anyway, just felt like you should know.
# s3_mc "Thanks, Rafi/Lily. I appreciate it."

# Rafi/Lily glances towards the Villa.
# R/L: I think we better be heading back.
# s3_mc "Probably."
# R/L: Thanks for coming, though, and for being so open to me. I had a great time.
# s3_mc "I'm flattered you picked me."
# You head back to the Villa together as the sun is going down.

# "Well, you tried your best, Rafi/Lily."
# "Turns out it really was just the body spray we could smell earlier."
# "That's one date down..."
# "But what about LI and Lily's/Rafi's date?"
# "It turns out love is in the air after all, folks!"
# "It sure looks like MC's head has been turned!"
# "And how will LI react to this, I wonder?"
# "Well, let's find out, shall we?"
# "Wait, you didn't think we were going to leave it there, did you?"

# genevieve "So anyway, he starts yelling at me. 'Miss! Miss! I've broken my leg!' Obviously he hadn't, but..."
# genevieve "Oh! Hey, you two!"
# elladine "Ooh MC! You're back!"
# nicky "Alright, guys?"
# s3_mc "Hi, everyone!"
# s3_mc "Sorry, Viv. Carry on with your story."
# genevieve "Oh no, no way! You're telling us about your date first. My story can wait."
# elladine "Yeah, how was it guys?"
# (choosing to recouple with them):
# Rafi/Lilyasmin "Well, obviously I had a pretty good time. But I'm not gonna speak for MC. "
# (not choosing to recouple with them):
# Rafi/Lily looks a little uncomfortable, and shrugs [his_her] shoulders.
# Choiceseb "How was my date with Rafi/Lily?"
# -Well, we might have shared a kiss (only appears if you kissed Rafi/Lily during the date)
# bff "Wow, you guys must have hit it off, then!"
# R/L: You could say that.
# nicky "Well, I hope it goes well for you both, obviously. I'm sure we all do."
# s3_mc "Thanks, Nicky. We'll see."
#  Rafi/Lily catches your eyes and smiles mischievously. (Telling Rafi/Lily to pick you)
# genevieve "So, what about LI?"
# nicky "Now, now. No need to jump to conclusions, Viv. I'm sure MC knows what she's doing."

# -Rafi/Lily wasn't for me
# s3_mc "Not being rude or anything. But I wasn't really into it."
# bff "I think that's fair enough. Gotta be honest about how you feel."
# R/L: Definitely. I don't regret it, either.
# bff "Anyway... you and LI have still got each other, so there's no emergency to find someone new, I guess."

# -I had a good time, actually
# s3_mc "I was a pleasant surprise! Rafi/Lily definitely knows how to take me on a date."
# bff "Ooh la la. Sounds promising."
# nicky "Well, I hope it goes well for you both, obviously. I'm sure we all do."
# s3_mc "Thanks, Nicky. We'll see."

# genevieve "So, what about LI?"
# nicky "Now, now. No need to jump to conclusions, Viv. I'm sure MC knows what she's doing."

# -Rafi/Lily was nice, but it didn't go anywhere
# s3_mc "We had a good time though, for sure. I appreciated it."
# bff "Suppose you can't ask for much more, right?"
# bff "Anyway... you and LI have still got each other, so there's no emergency to find someone new, I guess."

# s3_mc "Where is LI, anyway?"
# seb "[he_she] and Lily/Rafi haven't got back yet, actually. They should be back soon, though. It's getting dark."
# Just then, you hear laughter echoing down the hallway.
# Liona "There is no way that [he_she] actually... oh!"
# L: Oh, hey everyone!
# R/L: Had a good time, you two?
# L/R: A great time, I think. 
# L: Bill was just talking about how much of faff dating is, so I told him some of my dating horror stories.
# L: He's totally right, being in here is way better.
# bill "I mean, yeah. I've always said that's why I came in here. Less hassle, isn't it?"
# L: Harry was telling me about some of his meditation techniques. I've never been great at that stuff, and the one time I tried, my sister made fun of me!
# harry "Yeah, that's not on. It's a seriously beneficial thing that everyone ought to try once in a while."
# L: Defo.
# L: Camilo was just telling me about his awesome fam back home, so I was mentioning how much of a nightmare my sister can be.
# camilo "Isn't she watching, though?"
# L: What, this show? Nah, no way. Definitely not her kind of thing.
# R/L: We were swapping stories about her nightmare sports coaches and my downright nasty PE teachers. There was one in particular.
# aj "Honestly, he sounds awful! My coaches were intense, but never like that."
# L: We got really into chatting about rugby and Tai's career.
# L: He couldn't believe my ex played for the England women's team!
# tai "I could! It's just such a wild coincidence. The rugby world is tiny."
# L: It is a small world, I guess!
# L: Ciaran told me some of his bouncer stories over dinner, so I told him one of mine! Only I wasn't the bouncer, and it was my friend getting kicked out.
# ciaran "I'm telling you, I would have done the same."
# R/L: Yasmin was telling me about the last time she visited her mum in America.
# R/L: So we got into talking about family and I mentioned my brother, and well...
# yasmin "He's very lucky to have you as his family."
# Rafi/Lily shoots you a knowing look.
# LI seems to be avoiding eye contact with you.
# L/R: Oh, yeah! We wanted to ask you guys something, too. Earlier we were talking about...
# genevieve "Hold up guys! Text!"
# text "Islanders, tonight the Villa will play host to a nineties-themed club night, with a very special mystery guest! #dresstoimpress #naughtynineties #blastfromthepast"
# elladine "Who do you think it is?"

# elladine "The mystery host!"

# "Welcome back to Love Island!"
# "Previously..."
# "Our new Islanders wasted no time grafting on the others."
# R/L: Hey there...
# "Which has some of the Islanders worried..."
# R/L: Had a good time, you two?
# L/R: A great time, I think.
# s3_mc "..."
# "But there's no time to think on that, as our Islanders are off to the ultra exclusive Club Villa for a nineties themed night!"
# "Ahh, the nineties, I remember them well."
# "I couldn't use the internet if someone needed to use the phone."
# "My mobile would break the pavement if I dropped it."
# "And the height of televised entertainment was a show about how fast you could do your food shop..."
# "How times have changed!"

# The dressing room is buzzing with excitement as the girls flit about looking for bits of clothing to suit the theme.
# Dresses and jackets are flung out of wardrobes, hairspray fills the air, and a fine sheen of glitter twirls in the light.
# aj "What did people even wear back then?"
# elladine "Denim! Lots of denim."
# yasmin "Yeah and random futuristic fads."
# yasmin "My uncle always goes on about this awful shell suit and t-shirt combo that changed colour with body heat."
# elladine "That would not be a good look if you were notorious for having sweaty pits!"
# You overhear Miki/Iona murmuring.
# M/iona "I don't think I have any colours that are bright enough..."
# thought "The girls are all putting in extra effort to look the part for tonight's theme..."
# You flit around the room, grabbing a pair of dungarees, a bum bag, and as many glow-sticks as you can fit in it.
# Outfit change to 90s-Outfit
# elladine "Woah, MC! That outfit is 'dead sick'."
# s3_mc "What?"
# elladine "I'm trying to channel my younger self."
# Choiceseb "I bet the special guest is..."
# -Will Smith
# elladine "Ooh! Dressed like he was in the Fresh Prince!"

# -Sarah Michelle Gellar
# L: The only vampire slayer hotter than the vampires themselves?
# L: Count me in.

# -Britney Spears
# yasmin "Erm... is Britney really nineties?"
# genevieve "Yeah she absolutely is!"
# genevieve "I spent the whole summer of '99 learning the moves to Baby One More Time."
# yasmin "Could you still bust them out?"
# genevieve "I guess, we'll see later."

# elladine "That would be 'cool beans'!"
# elladine "I can't believe people used to talk like this..."
# L: I can't believe you're trying to bring it back.
# elladine "For tonight only! I want to be in theme."
# M/iona "I bet you get stuck talking like that."
# L: Yeah, if the wind changes or something.
# L: That's what my mum would say when I pulled faces.
# elladine "Classic parent line."
# At that moment, Nicky enters the room.
# nicky "Woah, all you girls look amazing!"
# elladine "And you, babe!"
# nicky "Let's do this! We gotta bounce."
# s3_mc "Time to party!"
# You and the other girls hurriedly make your way towards the door.

# Just before you leave the room, Lily gently takes hold of your hand.
# L: You should think about dressing like that more often.
# L. It's doing things for me...
# Choiceseb "Maybe..."
# -I will
# -But I doubt it
# -If you're good
# L: Aww, but I prefer being naughty... (you get 😏 with Lily)

# The two of you catch up with the others.

# You and the rest of the Islanders saunter into the 'club' like a group of A-List celebs.
# s3_mc "Where are we?"
# seb "I think it's the lounge..."
# L: It looks so different!
# R: VIP treatment, baby!
# An electrifying wave of energy hits you as beats from the past fill your ears.
# elladine "This place has been done up proper lush!"
# ciaran "It's alright, I guess. Hasn't got anything on the one back home..."
# (Gem option day 6 part 1 “waterford tour with Ciaran”):
# s3_mc "You have to admit, it looks way better than the one you took me to on our tour of Waterford."
# ciaran "I don't have to admit anything."
# L: Come on, Ciaran, the Villa looks pretty good all dressed up!
# ciaran "It's alright, I guess."
# yasmin "What? I can't hear you over these tunes!"
# L: I was saying the Villa has turned into a proper club.
# yasmin "That's a banging idea to be fair... Club Villa!"
# Choiceseb "'Club Villa' is..."
# -Totally whack...
# -Off the hook!
# B/camilo "Woah, talk about a throwback much. (you get 😂 with Bill/Camilo)"
# nicky "Some classic lingo!"
# aj "Huh? What hooks? I don't see any..."

# -Mega wrench!
# Liona "What?"
# Liona "That's not a phrase."
# nicky "Did you just make up some lingo?"
# s3_mc "No! My cousin said they said it all the time growing up."
# nicky "Your cousin and your cousin only."

# You're all just getting your dance on when suddenly the music stops and the lights go low.
# harry "Woah, what's going?"
# The lights facing the DJ stand flash on. Standing there is a short, well-built figure.
# The Islanders let out a massive cheer.
# yasmin "Is that...?"
# seb "It can't be!"
# genevieve "It is!"
# Timiki "Wassup, Islanders!"
# harry "It's Big T himself!"
# elladine "I had such a crush on him..."
# Choiceseb "'Big T' is the DJ..."
# -I can't believe he's here!
# elladine "I know! (you get 🤩 with Elladine)"
# elladine "I'm actually shaking!"
# elladine "Do you think he'd sign my cleavage?"
# nicky "I want him to sign my pecs if he does."

# -Sorry, who is that?
# yasmin "Are you serious?! (you get 😲 with Yasmin)"
# yasmin "It's Tim from Season 1 of Love Island."
# yasmin "I'm obsessed with his music."
# seb "Yeah, man. It's sound."

# -More like Swol T...
# tai "Right?! (you get 😂 with Tai)"
# tai "Man must be benching something serious. "
# nicky "Guess he really grew into his stage name."

# Timiki "Islanders!"
# Timiki "What time is it?"
# M/iona "Showtime!"
# Timiki "What time?"
# B/camilo "Showtime!"
# tai "What?"
# Choiceseb "It's..."
# -Bedtime!
# Timiki "Don't be like that, MC. (you get 😏 with Tim)"
# Timiki "I've got the killer beats to wake you up!"
# Timiki "But like for real, does anyone have the time?"
# seb "It's half nine?"
# tai "Oh..."
# Timiki "Looks like I got too excited and came out early..."

# -Showtime!

# Timiki "But like for real, does anyone have the time?"

# Timiki "Looks like I got too excited and came out early..."

# -Half nine?
# Timiki "Oh, really?"
# Timiki "Looks like I got too excited and came out early..."

# Timiki "I'll just whack on an absolute beast of a classic that's still played at weddings to this day!"
# He cranks up the volume on the Macarena and the room bursts back into a dancing frenzy.
# nicky "Oh! This is my jam!"
# Liona "Come on, babe. Let's dance!"
# You're surrounded by the others as they begin to reenact the moves from muscle memory.
# You have no choice but to go with the flow and join in.
# Choiceseb "OK, first I have to put my arms out... (timed choice with 5 seconds)"
# -Palms flat
# You throw your hands out with the palms facing down.
# To your relief, everyone's done the same.
# thought "It's coming back to me!"

# -Palms up
# You throw your hands out with the palms facing up.
# Unfortunately, everyone's palms are down.
# thought "Eh, I'm not that far off."

# -And spin them around
# You throw your arms out in front of you and begin to twirl them around wildly.
# No one seems to know what you're doing...

# The others flip their palms up. You follow along.
# Choiceseb "Right, now I cross my arms... (timed choice with 5 seconds)"
# -Over each other
# -Over my shoulders
# One at a time, you bring your arms to your shoulder...
# Just like everyone else.
# s3_mc "Nailed it!"

# -Onto my hips
# One at a time, you rest your hands onto your hips.
# Everyone else brings theirs to their shoulders.
# s3_mc "Oops..."

# Choiceseb "Finally, I need... (timed choice with 5 seconds)"
# -Throw your hands up in the air
# You throw your hands up, only to see everyone else bring their hands up behind their heads.
# thought "Damn..."

# -Put your hands behind your head
# With your hips still swinging, you bring your hands up behind your head.
# As do the others.

# -Spin around and shout 'Hey Macarena!'
# You spin on the spot.
# s3_mc "Hey Macarena!"
# bff "Um, a bit early..."
# Everyone else puts their hands behind their head.

# The song reaches its climax and everyone brings the dance to a close.
# R/L: Phew! I've not done that in years!
# L/R: Nice moves, LI...
# Liona "Thanks, you too!"
# thought "Lily/Rafi and LI still seem close..."
# thought "I don't know how their date went, but they seemed flirty enough around each other afterwards."
# (Telling Rafi/Lily to pick MC):
# thought "Good thing I told Rafi/Lily to pick me when it's time for the recoupling."
# (Rejecting Rafi/Lily earlier):
# You look over towards Rafi/Lily.
# Choiceseb "Lily/Rafi and LI are looking kind of flirty..."
# -Ask Rafi/Lily to pick you at the next recoupling
# -Trust that Lily/Rafi won't pick LI
# thought "Hmm, Lily/Rafi may not choose LI."
# thought "And it would be crushing if Lily/Rafi doesn't choose LI only for Rafi/Lily to choose me."

# -Dance in between them!
# You shimmer over and then flair your arms about.
# L/R: You alright there MC? Is that a dance move or a gesture for help?
# Before you can answer LI takes your hand and spins you around.
# Liona "You are such a goofball MC!"

# The music cuts out again.
# Big T looks confused.
# nicky "Yo! Where'd the tunes go?"
# Timiki "I don't know."
# A series of high-pitched beeps and whistles suddenly fill the room.
# harry "What's that noise?"
# seb "It's an old ringtone!"
# harry "Why does the phone sound like it's in pain?"
# seb "That's just how they all used to sound."
# elladine "Oh! It's my phone."
# s3_mc "What's it say?"
# elladine "Islanders, you're not just here for the good times and tunes. Two of you will need to make a huge decision."
# elladine "Tonight Lily and Rafi will choose who they're going to couple up with!"
# The group gasps.
# Timiki "Woah! That's big news."
# Timiki "I just thought I'd be here giving all of you a good time."
# Timiki "Guess we should see who they choose..."
# He pulls out a small bag of popcorn from under his decks.
# genevieve "It's already happening?"
# She looks over at Seb and takes his hand in hers.
# seb "Don't worry. I'm not going anywhere."
# genevieve "But you don't know that."
# seb "Yeah, well, I just feel it."
# s3_mc "This is it."
# thought "Rafi/Lily might pick me...(Telling Rafi/Lily to pick MC)"
# thought "I told Rafi/Lily not to pick me. I just hope Lily/Rafidoesn't choose LI...(Rejecting Rafi/Lily earlier)"
# Choiceseb "Lily and Rafi are about to choose who they're going to couple up with..."
# -Smile at LI
# You turn to look at LI and shoot [him_her] a sweet smile.
# [he_she] returns one back at you.
# thought "This could be the last moment we're a couple...(Rejecting Rafi/Lily earlier)"
# thought "Was telling Rafi/Lily to pick me a mistake?(Telling Rafi/Lily to pick MC)"

# -Smile at Rafi/Lily
# You flash a cheeky smile in Rafi's/Lily's direction.
# [he_she] shoot one back at you before gently biting [his_her] lips. (you get 😏 with Rafi/Lily) (Telling Rafi/Lily to pick MC)

# -Glare at Lily/Rafi
# You shoot Lily/Rafi a glare so cold it could freeze lava.
# [his_her] sweet smile is immediately replaced with a look of shock.
# thought "I may feel bad for doing that, but only if she doesn't pick LI... (Rejecting Rafi/Lily earlier)"

# Timiki "Yo, Lily/Rafi, it's your turn to pick."
# L/R: Alright, here goes, then...
# [he_she] seems nervous, maybe unsure. It's hard to tell.
# thought "What will LI do if Lily/Rafi doesn't pick [him_her]?(Telling Rafi/Lily to pick MC)"
# thought "What's going to happen to us if [he_she] picks LI?(Rejecting Rafi/Lily earlier)"
# L/R: This choice has been really hard, for many reasons...
# [he_she] lets out a deep breath.
# L/R: When I first entered the Villa, I was so convinced I knew who I was going to pick.
# L/R: And, getting to know that person only reinforced that decision.
# The others look around at each other. LI's smiling sadly.
# L/R: But [he_she] made it clear that [he_she] wasn't into me.(Telling Rafi/Lily to pick MC)
# Lily/Rafi looks at you.(Telling Rafi/Lily to pick MC)
# L/R: [he_she] was too committed to [his_her] partner...(Telling Rafi/Lily to pick MC)
# L/R: But [he_she] made it clear that [he_she] wasn't interested in me in that way.(Rejecting Rafi/Lily earlier)
# L/R: So I looked at my other options, and though this person wasn't my first pick, I know they're the right one.
# L/R: So with that, I'm going to couple up with...
# The converted lounge is absolutely silent as everyone waits for the answer.
# L/R: Nicky/Elladine.
# Everyone gaps, their eyes widen. But no one seems more shocked than Nicky and Elladine.
# Choiceseb " Lily/Rafi coupled up with Nicky/Elladine!"
# -Say nothing and watch

# -Hug Nicky(E+R)/Elladine(L+N)
# You lean over towards Nicky(E+R)/Elladine(L+N) and pull [him_her] into a comforting hug.
# E(L+N) / N(R+E): What just happened?

# -Look at LI
# You look at LI.
# Liona "You think anyone could tempt me away from you?"
# Liona "No chance."

# E(L+N) / N(R+E): Babe...
# You see Elladine's(L+N)/Nicky's(R+E) eyes fill with tears. [he_she] doesn't try to stop them as they begin to roll down her/his cheeks.
# E(L+N) / N(R+E): It's alright, babe. We knew this could happen...
# Timiki "Dang. This is a real buzzkill, yo."
# Nicky/Elladine walks over to Lily/Rafi and the two exchange a brief hug.
# (Telling Rafi/Lily to pick MC):
# Choiceseb "I told Rafi/Lily to pick me. That means LI will be left single..."
# -Maybe Rafi/Lily won't pick me
# -I've made a terrible mistake...
# thought "This is going to crush LI."

# -I have to think about my happiness
# thought "It's all about number one in here, after all."

# (Rejecting Rafi/Lily earlier):
# Choiceseb "I wonder who Rafi/Lily will pick?"
# -Maybe it'll be Elladine/Nicky
# thought "That would be the best thing to do."

# -I have no clue!
# thought "...and this suspense is doing my head in!"

# -I don't care as long as it isn't me
# thought "It's all about number one in here, after all."

# A sombre mood hangs over you and the rest of the Islanders.
# Timiki "Heavy, man..."
# Timiki "But... now I have to know who Rafi's gonna pick!"
# seb "Mate! Read the room."
# Timiki "What? We need to know, yo!"
# Timiki "So tell us, bro. Who you gonna choose?"
# Rafi/Lily sighs and then looks straight at you.
# R/L: Like Lily/Rafi, I came in here with my eye on one particular person...
# R/L: UnlikeLily/Rafi, though, I didn't have a second option in mind.
# R/L: Um, no offense Nicky/Elladine.
# R/L: No, I put all my eggs in one basket...
# (Telling Rafi/Lily to pick MC):
# R/L: And it seems like that gamble has paid off as when I asked this person if she'd be interested in me picking her...
# R/L: ...she said yes.
# R/L: So, tonight, the person I'd like to couple up with is...
# thought "Here we go."
# R/L: MC.
# seb "Woah..."
# LI's jaw drops open. [he_she] looks pleadingly at you.
# Liona "No..."
# Liona "Did that really just happen?"
# Choiceseb "LI's taking this hard..."
# -Kiss [his_her] cheek
# -Wave [him_her] off
# You casually wave at LI as you make your way over to Rafi/Lily.

# -Give [him_her] a hug
# You wrap your arms around LI and squeeze [him_her] tight, before walking over to Rafi/Lily.

# Liona "Don't go..."
# genevieve "This is so brutal."
# You reach Rafi/Lily.
# R/L: Hey there.
# Choiceseb "Hey..."
# -Kiss [him_her]
# You lean in towards Rafi/Lily and share a small kiss. (you get 😭 with LI and 😏 with Rafi/Lily)

# -Stand next to [him_her]
# You take your place next to Rafi/Lily. [he_she] smiles at you.

# -Hug [him_her]
# You embrace Rafi/Lily in a tight hug. (you get 🙁 with LI and 😍 with Rafi/Lily)

# Timiki "Alright, LI, mate, you're now single."
# Liona "Nope."
# Timiki "Um, yeah, you are?"
# Liona "No, because I'm walking."
# Everyone gasps. The others murmur.
# Timiki "Wait, you can do that?"
# Liona "I don't care if you can or can't. I am."
# Timiki "Fair. I mean, you're still single, though..."
# Before anyone can do or say anything, LI makes [his_her] way to the door, but turns just before going through.
# Liona "I thought me and MC had something special..."
# Liona "Clearly, I was wrong."
# [he_she] leaves without a further word.
# thought "LI..."
# (Rejecting Rafi/Lily earlier):
# R/L: But it seems like that gamble hasn't paid off.
# R/L: So, tonight, the person I'd like to couple up with is...
# thought "Here we go."
# R/L: No one.
# seb "Woah..."
# Timiki "Wait, you can do that?"
# Rafi/Lily shrugs.
# R/L: I don't care. I am.
# R/L: MC was honestly the only person I was interested in.
# R/L: If I can't be with her, then I don't want to break up another couple for the sake of it.
# R/L: I'm choosing to walk.
# Liona "Wow."
# Choiceseb "That's..."
# -A bit dramatic
# R/L: I'm sorry if it seems that way, but I just want to leave with my head held high.

# -So decent of you
# R/L: I don't want to cause any more heartache here. (you get 😏 with Rafi/Lily)

# -What I'd do, too
# R/L: That's because you're a lovely person. (you get 🙂 with Rafi/Lily)

# [he_she] smiles at the rest of the shocked Islanders.
# R/L: Hey, LI. Look after this one.
# [he_she] nods his head towards you.
# R/L: She's special. Don't forget that.
# Rafi/Lily turns on his heels without another word, and walks out of the door.
# LI turns to you, smiling.
# AJ/C/T/camilo "Well that was dramatic..."
# Liona "Rafi's/Lily's right."
# Liona "You are special."
# Liona "To me especially."
# Choiceseb "LI says I'm special to [him_her]..."
# -Kiss [him_her]
# You lean over to LI. [he_she] meets you halfway and your lips connect.
# Both of your lips tremble as small tears roll down your cheeks.

# -Hug [him_her]
# You pull [him_her] into a tight squeeze. Both of your bodies tremble slightly as small tears roll down your cheeks.

# -Say it back to [him_her]
# s3_mc "You're special to me, too!"
# [he_she] wipes at a small tear that's started to make its way down [his_her] cheek.

# Liona "That was too close."

# seb "So that happened."
# Timiki "There's only one thing we can do in these hard times..."
# Timiki "Party!"
# The music kicks back in, but this time, the rest of the Islanders stand around unsure what to do.
# They are still in shock about what just happened.
# Choiceseb "I can't believe that..."
# -Rafi's/Lily's gone (MC sticking with her former partner)
# thought "At least no one else got split up!"

# -Lily/Rafi went with Nicky/Elladine
# thought "What does that mean for Elladine/Nicky?"

# -Tim expects us to keep dancing
# thought "Like, really?"

# -MC's former partner's gone (MC recoupling with Rafi/Lily)
# thought "I can't believe it's over between us..."

# LI puts an arm around you and gives you a gentle squeeze.
# R/L: Hey, I know the rest of tonight may be a bit difficult...(MC recoupling with Rafi/Lily)
# R/L: But I want you to know that I'm here for you, yeah?(MC recoupling with Rafi/Lily)
# s3_mc "Thanks, babe. That's good to hear.(MC recoupling with Rafi/Lily)"
# (MC sticking with her former partner)
# AJ/C/T/camilo "Looks like you're stuck with me for a bit longer."
# AJ/C/T/camilo "Thank goodness."
# B/H/Cam/AJ/C/T/yasmin "I did not enjoy the thought of losing you just then."
# s3_mc "No?"
# B/H/Cam/AJ/C/T/yasmin "Of course not. I'd have been devastated..."
# Liona "Someone's not having a good night, though."
# [he_she] points over towards Elladine(L+N) / Nicky(R+E), who's stood on the dance floor looking sadly towards Elladine(L+N) / Nicky(R+E).
# s3_mc "I better go and say something."
# Liona "Alright, babe. I'll be here when you come back."
# You approach Elladine(L+N) / Nicky(R+E).
# (Elladine(L+N) / Nicky(R+E) as BFF):
# s3_mc "Hey, friend..."
# E(L+N) /N(R+E): MC! Thank goodness. I really need a friend right now.
# (Elladine(L+N) / Nicky(R+E) not as BFF):
# s3_mc "Hey, Elladine(Lily picked Nicky) / Nicky(Rafi picked Elladine)..."
# E(L+N) / N(R+E): Oh, hey, MC.
# Choiceseb "What should I say to Elladine(L+N) / Nicky(R+E)?"
# -Well that sucks, doesn't it?
# E(L+N) / N(R+E): That's one way of bluntly putting it.

# -I'm so sorry for what happened
# E(L+N) / N(R+E): Yeah... me, too.
# E(L+N) / N(R+E): I haven't really accepted that it has.

# -How're you doing?
# E(L+N) / N(R+E): Terrible.

# E(L+N) / N(R+E): I've just got so many questions running through my head right now.
# E(L+N) / N(R+E): What happens to me?
# E(L+N) / N(R+E): What is everyone thinking about me right now?
# E(L+N) / N(R+E): And...
# E(L+N) / N(R+E): ...what if Nicky and Lily/Elladine and Rafi actually make a good couple?
# Choiceseb "I..."
# -Think you'll find someone else
# E(L+N) / N(R+E): In here? No chance. (you get 😭 with Elladine/Nicky)
# E(L+N) / N(R+E): And I don't want anyone else. I want Nicky/Elladine...

# -Doubt anyone is thinking badly about you
# E(L+N) / N(R+E): You're probably right.
# E(L+N) / N(R+E): I still can't help but feel embarrassed and hurt, though.

# -Believe Nicky/Elladine will wait for you
# E(L+N) / N(R+E): That's comforting to hear. (you get 🙂 with Elladine/Nicky)
# E(L+N) / N(R+E): Whether it happens in here or not, I want to stay with Nicky/Elladine.

# -Don't know how to answer any of that
# E(L+N) / N(R+E): Yeah, fair enough. (you get 🙁 with Elladine/Nicky)
# E(L+N) / N(R+E): I don't know what to think about the questions either.

# Elladine(L+N) / Nicky(R+E) heads to the exit.
# E(L+N) / N(R+E): Thanks for coming over and checking in.
# E(L+N) / N(R+E): But... I think I need to get some fresh air and clear my head.
# Elladine(L+N) / Nicky(R+E) gives you a hug before turning and walking towards the door.
# You turn to head back to LI and bump straight into Tim.
# s3_mc "Agh!"
# Timiki "Yo! Careful. You nearly spilled my drink all over these thick threads."
# s3_mc "Sorry."
# Timiki "No harm done."
# Timiki "I was actually coming over to see if you and LI wanted to join me in the VIP booth?"
# s3_mc "We have a VIP booth?"
# Timiki "Hell yeah we do!"
# Timiki "Sure, some may call it 'the hideaway'..."
# Timiki "But tonight, it's the VIP booth. And I'm allowed to give one couple access to it."
# Timiki "I figured you and LI could use it."
# s3_mc "Really?"
# Timiki "Yeah, boi! It's wicked in there. I figured you could do with getting away from all this drama and shizz."
# s3_mc "Why us?"
# Timiki "You two seem like the best-suited couple if I'm honest."
# Timiki "You got that sweet love heart energy! So what do you say?"
# Choiceseb "Do I want to go to the VIP booth with LI and Tim?"
# -Hell yeah! Who wouldn't take this opportunity? (gem choice)
# -Nah. Exclusive access to a VIP booth isn't for me
# Timiki "Really?"
# Timiki "I was honestly not expecting that."
# Just then, LI comes over.
# Liona "Hey, babe! What's up?"
# s3_mc "Oh, Tim just invited us to his VIP booth is all."
# Liona "That's amazing! Where is it?"
# Timiki "Steady on. MC said she wasn't interested."
# Liona "Babe, what? We have to go! I want to see this booth."
# Choiceseb "LI really wants to see the VIP booth..."
# -Alright, fine. We'll go if it makes you happy (gem choice)
# -Sorry, babe, but I'm still not interested
# Liona "That's fine, babe. We can stay out here and continue to get our freak on."
# Timiki "Dang."
# Timiki "Oh well. I'll go and see who else wants to check it out."
# Timiki "Laters!"
# He leaves you and LI on the dance floor.
# You both carry on dancing for a while longer, but you can't get over the feeling that you missed out on an amazing time...

# Gem choicelladine ""
# Timiki "That's what I'm talking about! (you get 🥰 with Tim)"
# Timiki "OK! Let's go grab LI and I'll show you where it's at."

# Tim leads you and LI past to the hideaway.
# Tim has stuck a piece of paper on the door which reads 'VIP Booth'.
# You and LI exchange glances and stifle a giggle as he opens the door.
# The giggles fade as you look around, you barely recognise the room, now a luxurious chill out area.
# Timiki "Behold! My VIP booth."
# Liona "Now this I could get used to!"
# Liona "This room is amazing..."
# Liona "You can barely tell that a king-sized bed was ever in here."
# Choiceseb "Your VIP booth is..."
# -Kinda tacky
# -Da bomb!
# Timiki "I know, right? (you get 🥰 with Tim)"
# Timiki "The sofa cushions have built-in bum massagers!"

# -So much quieter
# Timiki "Yeah, tell me about it."
# Timiki "It's so quiet I can hear the constant ringing in my ears..."

# He flops down onto the sofa and takes a deep breath.
# Timiki "C'mon, get comfy. It's not every day you get to live this kind of luxury. You get me?"
# You and LI slip onto the sofa opposite Tim.
# Liona "I don't really get you Tim, but my bum has never been so comfy!"
# Timiki "Just wait till the massagers kick in."
# Choiceseb "So, Tim..."
# -What have you been up to?
# Timiki "Just really getting my music career off the ground. (you get 😏 with Tim)"
# Timiki "Been playing all the big clubs!"
# Timiki "Oh, and some promotion stuff for this asparagus based drink..."

# -Who are you? I still don't know
# Timiki "Ouch. You know how to cut a man deep, MC. (you get 🙁 with Tim and 😳 with LI)"
# Timiki "I'm Big T! World famous DJ and contestant from Season 1 on Love Island."

# -How did you get so big, Big T?
# Timiki "Oh, you mean these bad boys?"
# He flexes his biceps and kisses each one in turn.
# Liona "Woah, calm down. The sun's not even out."
# Timiki "I like to tell people it happened through an intense montage like in Rocky..."
# Timiki "But that's because the actual answer is really dull. I just worked out a lot and ate well."

# Liona "How's things with Jen?"
# Tim's gaze drops to the floor.
# Timiki "Oh, yeah... things ended with Jen a while ago."
# LI's face flushed red.
# Liona "I'm, um, sorry to hear that."
# Timiki "Hey, no sweat! I'm currently with the love of my life, so that's great."
# Timiki "It took me way too long to realise who she was..."
# Timiki "But tonight isn't about me!"
# Timiki "Well, it kinda is."
# Timiki "But right now, it's about you two!"
# Timiki "Things got intense out there."
# Timiki "What with Rafi/Lily/former partner walking out..."
# Timiki "But you two make a sick couple!"
# Timiki "Let's toast to this!"
# He takes the champagne from the bucket. The bottle's empty and the ice has melted.
# Timiki "Oh, weird..."
# Timiki "No worries! I'll get us something else to drink. What do you two want?"
# Liona "A rum and coke."
# Choiceseb "I'll have..."
# -Some bubbly
# Timiki "Yeah, I was well looking forward to that, too."

# -A cranberry juice
# Timiki "Big up the cranberries!"
# Liona "What?"
# Timiki "I don't know..."

# -What he's/she's having...
# Timiki "Two Runny C's coming right up!"
# Liona "Please don't call them that."

# Timiki "I'll be right back. Don't do anything I wouldn't do."
# Timiki "Which isn't much..."
# He walks out, leaving you and LI alone in the booth.
# LI slides closer to you.
# Liona "Hey, so... looks like we're all alone in an exclusive VIP booth."
# Choiceseb "We... (no further reactions)"
# -Better take advantage of that
# -Can do anything we like...

# Bill lightly touches your cheek and smiles at you.
# bill "I love these moments."

# bill "But what I really look forward to is getting to spend time with you."
# Choiceseb "Bill said that spending time with me is the best part of being here..."
# -I feel the same way
# He grins.
# bill "That's good."

# bill "Oh, thanks!"
# s3_mc "Don't get me wrong, I love it when we get to spend time together."

# s3_mc "People energise me."
# He smiles warmly.
# bill "It's OK. I get that."

# -Make the most of it and kiss me, then
# He wastes no time in planting a deep, slow kiss on your lips.
# His fingers run lightly down your shoulders and his other hand touches your hip.
# You lose track of time. Eventually, you pull apart.

# bill "It's funny the way things turn out, isn't it?"
# bill "I'd never have dreamed I'd end up doing something like this."
# s3_mc "You mean your childhood ambition wasn't to be sent to a luxurious island to meet the girl of your dreams?"
# He laughs.
# bill "Can't say it was, no."
# bill "My childhood ambition was to play for Chelsea."
# s3_mc "I can't imagine you as a kid. When I try, it's just you but small."
# bill "I mean, I was pretty similar to how I am now. Seriously, lots of opinions. Played footy with my mates."
# bill "When I was about four years old, I told my mum that putting mushrooms in spag bol was 'total bloody nonsense'."
# bill "She went spare."
# bill "I was right, though."
# bill "How about you? What were you like as a kid?"
# Choiceseb "What kind of child was I?"
# -I was a real rebel
# bill "Somehow I don't find that difficult to believe."
# s3_mc "Oi!"
# bill "Just mean that you're, like, outgoing and that."
# s3_mc "In a good way?"
# bill "In a very good way."

# -I was shy and quiet
# bill "You're kidding."
# s3_mc "I guess it took me a while to come out of my shell."
# bill "Well, I'm glad you're here, outside of your shell."

# -I was never a child
# s3_mc "They found me fully-grown inside an alien pod."
# bill "So you're an alien?"
# s3_mc "Yep. Blarp weeble."
# He chuckles, blue eyes crinkling at the corners.
# bill "You're a right one, MC."
# bill "You've made this whole experience so great."

# bill "I'm excited to see what happens in the rest of our time here."
# Choiceseb "It sounds like Bill's thinking about our future together."
# -Squeeze his hand
# You give his warm, solid hand a squeeze. He squeezes back.

# -Give him a little kiss
# You lean in and plant a soft kiss on his cheek. He grins.

# -Smile at him
# You grin at him and he grins back, warm and genuine.

# The air between you and Harry glows with summer warmth and crackles with electricity.
# Choiceseb "He looks amazing."
# -Kiss him softly
# -Give him a hug
# -Kiss him hard
# You fling your arms around his neck and kiss him passionately on the mouth.
# His hands come up to your waist and clutch at your body.

# Choiceseb "Harry said I'm great..."

# -I'm just normal
# -So are you
# harry "Thanks."

# harry "My dad always told me I'd meet someone like you one day. But I never really believed him..."
# s3_mc "I haven't heard you talk about your family much. What are they like?"
# harry "My parents are really, really cool. My dad's a concert pianist and my mum's a university lecturer."
# harry "They're really into humanitarian causes and that, and they used to foster a lot of kids."
# harry "Me and my brother and sisters are all adopted after my parents fostered us, actually."
# Choiceseb "Harry's adopted..."
# -How old were you?
# -Your parents sound really nice
# He smiles fondly.
# harry "They really are."

# -I'm adopted too!
# harry "Oh, no way! I didn't know that."
# s3_mc "Yeah. I don't talk about it much."
# harry "I get that. I don't feel the need to broadcast it either."
# harry "But thanks for telling me, it makes me feel closer to you that we have that in common."
# Choiceseb "Harry feels closer to me knowing we're both adopted..."
# -It's just another part of me
# -I just want to hear more gossip.
# -It's good talking about it with you
# s3_mc "Not everyone gets what it's like."
# harry "I know what you mean."
# harry "Sometimes the other rich kids at uni expect me to think like them about stuff."
# harry "But my parents are really great. They understand."

# harry "How about you? Do you get on with your parents?"
# Choiceseb "Harry's wondering if I get on with my parents..."
# -We don't see each other much
# - I just want to hear more gossip about you!
# -We're really close
# s3_mc "I can't wait to go and have Sunday lunch with them after the Villa."
# s3_mc "We'll have so much to catch up on!"
# harry "Oh my gosh, my dad's strawberry cheesecake's amazing."
# harry "When we all get together it's a really good feeling."

# s3_mc "What about your brother and sisters?"
# harry "My sister Alex is a piano teacher. My dad tries to teach us all piano, but only she really took to it."
# harry "She's one of those people who keeps a planner and writes a journal every night."
# Choiceseb "She sounds..."
# -Intimidating 
# -Talented
# harry "She really is."

# -Organised
# harry "She's easily the most organised person in my family. And I'm including my parents in that!"

# harry "My other sister Charlotte's doing a PhD in Organic Chemistry."
# harry "You know those girls who wear chunky jewellery, ooze charisma, the really bright, bold kinda one... that's Charlotte."
# Choiceseb "She sounds..."
# -Loud
# -Clever
# harry "She's so clever. Sometimes it scares me a bit."

# -Fun
# harry "There's nobody you'd rather have at a party."

# harry "That leaves my brother Archie. He's still in school."
# harry "I think he mostly cares about playing battle royale games with his mates, but he's also really into tae kwon do."
# Choiceseb "He sounds..."
# -Like he needs direction

# -Like a good kid
# harry "Yeah, he is. He's a bit annoying sometimes, but that's little brothers, right?"

# -Cool
# s3_mc "I wanna play battle royale games with him."
# harry "I'm sure he'd love that."

# s3_mc "I hope I get to meet them all one day."
# harry "I hope so too."
# He smiles at you.

# camilo "Hey, MC? Do you believe in..."
# He trails off, you wait for him to finish... but he doesn't.
# s3_mc "In what? God? Aliens? Love?"
# camilo "Yeah, that last one."
# s3_mc "You can say it, you know. It's not a dirty word!"
# camilo "Yeah. It's just... awkward to talk about, innit?"
# Choiceseb "Camilo thinks it's awkward to talk about love..."
# -Yeah, it is a bit, isn't it?
# -Is that why it's called 'Strong Affection Island'?
# -It doesn't have to be
# s3_mc "Just don't think about it too hard."
# s3_mc "We're all just people struggling along, feeling the same feelings as everyone else."

# camilo "So have you ever been, you know, in love?"
# Choiceseb "Have I been in love before?"
# -Yes, of course
# -Not yet
# -I've thought I was
# s3_mc "And maybe I was? Who knows what love is, really."
# camilo "It's like, forever and that. Right?"

# camilo "For me, when I think about love, I think about my family. That's what it's all about, you get me?"
# camilo "I would do anything for my family and that's no joke. But I've never felt about a girl that way."
# Choiceseb "That's a pretty high bar for love..."
# -You could be missing out
# -But you still came to Love Island?
# -There are different kinds of love
# camilo "Like what?"
# s3_mc "Well, like the love you have for your friends, or a sport."
# camilo "Like jiu jitsu?"
# s3_mc "Exactly. Do you love jiu jitsu and your family the same way?"
# camilo "I guess not..."

# camilo "You know, when I applied for Love Island, I just thought it would be a bit of a laugh."
# camilo "Lush location, fit birds, who doesn't want a bit of that? Plus, free holiday."
# camilo "But recently, I've been thinking about some stuff."
# Camilo looks at you longingly. He opens his mouth to speak and sighs.
# camilo "I've never met anyone like you before."
# camilo "I mean never. I..."
# It looks like there might be more, but he closes his mouth and smiles at you.
# Choiceseb "Camilo says he's never met anyone like me before..."
# -Tell him you understand
# -Tell him that's because you're one of a kind
# -Kiss him
# You put your arm out and stroke the back of his head, pulling him in for a long, deep kiss.
# The kiss goes on for a long time.
# thought "Is he trying to avoid talking?"
# He pulls away and gives you one of those heart-melting smiles.
# camilo "I know I'm being proper frustrating."
# camilo "But... I just need a bit of time, yeah?"
# camilo "This is all so new to me."
# camilo "Blimey. What a melt."
# s3_mc "I don't think you're a melt. You're great."
# s3_mc "Well, maybe a bit of a melt."

# AJ points at her cheek.
# aj "My cheek is, like, so cold."
# s3_mc "Cold?"
# s3_mc "But it's really hot here..."
# aj "Yeah, I know, I know."
# aj "I'm just trying to be sneaky."
# aj "I would love a cheeky kiss on the cheek from you, if you want..."
# Choiceseb "Shall I give AJ a cheeky kiss?"
# -Poke her cheek
# -Kiss her bum
# You swoop around and kiss her right on her bum.
# She laughs hysterically.
# aj "Oh, so you're the really cheeky one."
# aj "I get it."

# -Kiss her cheek
# You softly kiss her cheek.

# aj "Honestly, sometimes I don't realise, like, how cheeky I can be. (you get 😍 with AJ)"
# aj "I'm apparently a pretty forward flirt."
# aj "When I'm not in a relationship, obviously..."
# Choiceseb "AJ says she's flirty..."
# -I'm even worse
# s3_mc "I don't even know when to stop myself."
# aj "It's hard, isn't it?"

# -I'm really shy
# aj "You seem comfortable around me, hun!"

# -That's obvious
# She blushes.
# aj "Only to the people I like."

# aj "When I was younger I used to, like, struggle a bit to keep a lid on flirty AJ."
# aj "Because I used to, you know, get bored really easily."
# aj "But since I met you that lid is tightly screwed."
# aj "I really don't feel, like, the need to anymore."
# aj "I just only want to get flirty and dirty with you."
# Choiceseb "Aj wants to get flirty and dirty with me..."
# -That's the weirdest line ever
# -Come her and kiss me properly then
# s3_mc "Actions speak louder than words."
# She grins and leans into you.
# Your lips touch. She tastes like strawberry laces.
# Her hand slowly strokes down your back.
# s3_mc "Cheeky."
# aj "You know it."

# She smiles at you.
# aj "I'm just so happy though, like."
# aj "I've never really wanted to keep a lid on flirty AJ."
# aj "Or cared enough to think about it."
# aj "You're worth keeping that lid on."
# aj "Which is an even weirder line than my last one."

# Tai shifts closer. You feel his light breath on your cheek.
# His lips curve in that smile that feels familiar now, but still exciting.
# tai "MC, you look so good."
# tai "I'd say good enough to eat, but that sounds wrong."
# tai "Or right."
# Choiceseb "Tai's so close..."
# -Give him a hug
# -Kiss him
# You lean in to kiss Tai's neck. As you lightly scrape your teeth along his skin, his pulse quickens.
# You brush your lips across his cheek to his mouth, and he kisses you back enthusiastically, his body against yours.
# He draws back, then lightly strokes your lip with a fingertip. Chills shiver all down your spine.

# -Tease him with food talk
# You lean in close to Tai's ear.
# s3_mc "What if I got some honey..."
# tai "Ooh, this sounds good already."
# s3_mc "...and dipped my finger in it..."
# Tai's eyes half close.
# s3_mc "...and then washed my hands because I'm not ruining my nails."
# tai "What a tragic tale. (you get 😂 with Tai)"
# He lightly strokes your cheek with a fingertip.

# Quiet stretches out between you, and Tai's expression shifts from blissful to unsure.
# tai "So!"
# tai "How about that weather, eh?"
# Choiceseb "Tai's asking about the weather..."
# -Er, it's weather?
# -It's nice today, isn't it?
# s3_mc "It's so warm, but there's that nice light breeze."
# s3_mc "Perfect."
# tai "Yeah. Yeah, it is, isn't it?"

# -Why are you suddenly into weather?
# tai "Well, you know, it's weather, right?"
# tai "There's air, and sky, and stuff."

# tai "Everything's perfect."
# tai "You're perfect, I'm perfect."
# He trails off and bites his lips.
# tai "The lawn's perfect too!"
# thought "Tai doesn't seem himself."
# Choiceseb "I wonder what's going on with him?"
# -Maybe he's feeling down?
# -Has he changed his mind about us?
# thought "We're getting closer to the final."
# thought "Could Tai be having second thoughts?"

# -Is something bothering him?
# thought "Tai's normally so chilled out."
# thought "Could he have something on his mind?"

# s3_mc "Is something bothering you, Tai?"
# tai "Huh? Is it? I don't think so! (you get 😍 with Tai)"
# Choiceseb "It doesn't seem that way."
# -Make a joke of it
# -Wait for him to talk
# You patiently let Tai avoid your eye for a few minutes. Eventually, he looks back at you.

# -I know something's up
# s3_mc "I can tell you've got something on your mind."
# s3_mc "Spill the tea. You'll feel better for it."

# He sighs.
# tai "OK, OK."
# tai "MC, when I came here, I was hoping I'd meet a special someone."
# tai "But I didn't know I'd meet someone like you."
# tai "And I love getting people flowers, surprising them with a present."
# tai "I should be an expert. But I haven't really had something like this before."
# Choices:
# -What's so different now?
# s3_mc "You've been with people before. What's different now?"

# -I don't get it
# s3_mc "Every relationship is different."
# s3_mc "You never know what's going to happen next."
# s3_mc "That's what makes it fun."

# -I know what you mean
# s3_mc "In the Villa, everything's so intense."
# s3_mc "It's amazing getting to know everyone."
# s3_mc "But it's so different to how it is outside."

# tai "I suppose it feels weird."
# s3_mc "Being with me?"
# tai "No way."

# -Sometimes I feel weird too
# -You've got nothing to worry about
# -Everyone's weird, and that's good

# s3_mc "It's nothing to be ashamed of."
# s3_mc "Apart from being kind to each other, there's no set way to act."
# s3_mc "And that can feel tricky."
# tai "There's so many ways to be nice when you like someone!"
# tai "It's hard to choose the best one."

# ciaran "I wish, but I don't have anything to write on."

# -Use my t-shirt
# -That's a shame

# s3_mc "We?"
# ciaran "Yeah! Unless you don't want to?"
# s3_mc "I'd love to!"

# ciaran "So, what's the distress signal about?"
# Choiceseb "It's..."
# -A food shortage
# -A missing dog
# ciaran "Oh no!"
# ciaran "But it's a mystery! Very classy. Never been done on Kerry & Ciaran before!"

# -An alien invasion 
# ciaran "I like it! Aliens invading other aliens!"

# ciaran "OK. So once we get to the alien planet, we assess the threat. Kerry has this amazing way of planning what our next steps are."
# ciaran "Do you think we can handle this issue alone or do we need backup?"
# Choiceseb "Do Kerry and Ciaran need back up?"

# -The aliens are trying to kill you!
# -I'm pregnant, it's yours!
# ciaran "What? You're not even in this!"
# ciaran "But OK, I can work with it."
# ciaran "Ciaran gets a call to say his wife is going into labour on Earth, and it distracts him from the problem at hand!"
# ciaran "But never fear, Ciaran can compartmentalise and puts his wife to the back of his mind for the sake of the plot."
# ciaran "The fictional Ciaran, that is."
# s3_mc "I'm your wife in this story?"
# ciaran "Creative licence."

# -Kerry is hungry!
# ciaran "Oh no! She gets terrible when she's hungry."
# ciaran "You can barely hear through all her barking."
# ciaran "Never fear, then alien planet's top cuisine just happens to be kibble! Kerry fills her belly and is back on the case!"

# ciaran "We can work out the logistics later, but somehow we solve the problem and the aliens throw us a party! What's the theme?"
# Choiceseb "It's..."
# -Prom
# -Wait, how did we solve it?
# -Circus
# ciaran "A great idea!"
# ciaran "Aliens don't know what a circus is so they accidentally throw you a farm-themed party."

# -Earth
# ciaran "A taste of home for the heroes!"
# ciaran "But the aliens have only seen Norfolk, and therefore throw you a farm-themed party."

# ciaran "You dance the night away, surrounded by humans dressed as cows, and cows dressed as humans."
# ciaran "Once your wonderful farm party is over, you head back to Earth for a long nap, Kerry curled up at your feet."
# ciaran "And that's a wrap!"
# ciaran "Thanks for doing that with me, MC!"

# -That's a bit weird
# -Only one song?
# -That's so sweet!
# s3_mc "Babe! That's so romantic."
# yasmin "I'm so glad. (you get 😍 with Yasmin)"

# s3_mc "What does it sound like? Can you sing it for me?"
# yasmin "Not yet. I'm sorry. It's not ready."
# yasmin "I want to get the melody right before you hear it..."
# yasmin "And I still haven't even decided what the last verse should be about."
# Choiceseb "The last verse should be about..."
# -The time I slew a dragon
# -My beautiful eyes
# s3_mc "And how they sparkle in the moonlight, that kind of thing."
# yasmin "I mean.. you do have beautiful eyes."
# yasmin "But there's so many beautiful things about you. It's hard to focus on just one."

# -Our future together
# s3_mc "Write about all the things we're going to do together once this is over. I'd like that."
# yasmin "You... you really mean that?"
# s3_mc "Of course."

# The last of her nervousness melts away, as a soft smile spreads across her face. (you get 😍 with Yasmin)
# yasmin "Thanks for the songwriting advice, MC."
# She gently strokes the back of your hand.
# Choiceseb "This would be the perfect moment..."
# -Enjoy it quietly
# -Look away from her
# -Go in for a kiss
# You slowly move closer. (you get 😍 with Yasmin)
# Yasmin closes her eyes and adopts a half-smile, half-pout, ready to be kissed.
# Her lips are perfectly soft and she sighs happily as she kisses you back.

# yasmin "I promise, as soon as this song is finished, you'll be the first to know."

# Rafi's gaze focuses intently upon you. He draws you closer, and his breath catches.
# R: I can't tell you how good it feels, being so close to you.
# R: Normally I'm good with words, but you look so...
# He trails off. He gazes at you, silently drinking you in.
# thought "He's so close..."
# Choiceseb "Shall I kiss him?"
# -Give Rafi a hug

# -Boop Rafi's nose
# s3_mc "You're adorable."
# You poke him lightly on the nose.
# s3_mc "Boop!"
# R: I don't think anyone's ever done that to me before.
# R: You're adorable too, MC.

# -Kiss Rafi
# s3_mc "We don't have to use words if you don't want to..."
# Rafi's eyes spark with excitement.
# R: Oh, now that sounds just right.
# You pull him close, kissing along the sharply chiselled line of his jaw, then drawing your lips to the hollow of his neck.
# Rafi gasps in your ear as your lips brush his neck. His arms tighten around you, and he slides a hand down your back.

# R: I'm so over the moon about picking you. (you get 😍 with Rafi)
# He draws his fingertips down your cheek, along your jaw, down the sensitive skin of your neck.
# R: Obviously I felt the spark between us...
# R: But it's not the same as actually being with you.
# Rafi whispers in your ear, his breath tickling your skin.
# R: I knew I wanted you from the moment I saw you.
# Choiceseb "Even when we didn't know each other, Rafi knew he wanted me..."
# -I needed time to warm up
# s3_mc "At first I wasn't quite sure..."
# Rafi gasps theatrically.
# R: How could you have doubts about this face?
# s3_mc "But once we'd had some quality time, I knew you were a bit of me."

# -How about when I was on TV?
# s3_mc "What did you think of me when you watched me on TV?"
# R: You were stunning, obviously.

# -I knew I wanted you, too
# s3_mc "As soon as you stepped out of that wardrobe..."
# s3_mc "I knew you were a bit of me."

# R: I love how you are, here in the Villa.
# R: It makes me want to...
# He murmurs in your ear with the hint of a moan in his voice.
# R: ...show you just how special I think you are.
# Choiceseb "Rafi wants to show me how special I am..."
# -I'd rather take it slow
# -How about I tease you instead?
# s3_mc "How about we see how long you can hold out..."
# R: Ooh, now that's intriguing.
# R: I'm always up for a bit of delayed gratification.
# You lightly run your fingernails along Rafi's collarbone. He shivers, looking up at you hungrily.
# R: I'm not ticklish, but that's... marvellous.
# As you skim your palm down his chest, Rafi looks determined to keep his cool, but he grows more and more flustered.
# When it's too much for him, he pulls away breathlessly.
# R: You're very good at teasing.

# -I'd love to kiss you
# s3_mc "I'd love to get hot and heavy with you."
# Rafi's gaze smoulders as he gives you a slow smile.
# R: That's exactly what I hoped to hear.
# Rafi slides his hands confidently along the curves of your hips, drawing you close.
# As heat builds between you, every touch is delight. Your skin tingles, aching for more.
# Rafi draws back and leans his forehead against yours.

# R: This is absolutely wonderful. I knew I was right to pick you.

# Lily's intense gaze focuses upon you. As she draws closer, her breath catches in her throat.
# L: Baby, you look incredible.
# Her gaze rakes over your face, as though she's sizing up a delicious snack.
# thought "She looks like she could eat me up..."
# Choiceseb "Shall I kiss her?"
# -Give Lily a hug
# -Boop Lily's nose
# -Kiss Lily
# s3_mc "I feel so lucky to be here with you."
# You pull Lily close, kissing along the cure of her cheek before drawing your lips along to the hollow of his neck.
# She gasps in your ear as your lips brush her neck. Her arms tighten around you, and she slides a hand down your back.

# L: I was sure we had a spark, and knowing I was right feels fantastic. (you get 😍 with Lily)
# L: And not just because I have to be right all the time.
# Lily leans close, and her lips brush your ear as she whispers.
# L: Even before we met, I knew who I wanted.
# Choiceseb "Even when we hadn't met, Lily knew she wanted me..."
# -I needed time to warm up
# -I knew I wanted you, too
# s3_mc "As soon as you stepped out of that wardrobe..."
# s3_mc "I knew you were a bit of me."

# -What did you think of me on TV?
# s3_mc "I bet you were glued to the screen when I was on."
# s3_mc "What did you think of me?"
# L: I thought 'I want to couple up with that girl'.

# Lily surveys you, drinking you in.
# L: And now I'm right here with you.
# L: You make me want to...
# She murmurs in your ear, a hint of a moan in her voice.
# L: Show you just how good you make me feel.
# Choiceseb ""
# -I'd rather take it slow
# -How about I tease you instead?
# s3_mc "Or I can give you a test..."
# s3_mc "See how long you can hold out."
# L: Ooh!
# L: Normally I dive straight in, but I'd be well up for that.
# You lightly run your fingernails down Lily's neck. She shivers, biting her lip.
# L: You're... very... tempting.
# As you skim your palm down her chest, Lily groans with delighted frustration.
# When it's too much for her, she pulls away, breathing hard.
# L: Almost too tempting.

# -I'd love to kiss you
# s3_mc "I'd love to get hot and heavy with you."
# Lily's lips curve in a slow, satisfied smile.
# L: Fantastic.
# Lily slides her hands confidently along the curves of your hips, drawing you close.
# As your kisses deepen, every touch is a delight. Your skin tingles, aching for more.
# Lily nuzzles lightly against your neck, her lips brushing along your skin.

# L: I knew I was right about you. (you get 😍 with Lily)

# The two of you sit back on the sofa.
# Tim's still nowhere to be seen.
# Choiceseb "Me and LI could put that pole to good use..."
# -Continue to cuddle on the couch but nothing more
# The two of you continue to relax on the sofa, chatting idly amongst yourselves.
# Eventually, the door opens.

# -Suggest you and LI do bits
# You stand up and turn to face LI.
# Liona "Babe...?"
# Without saying a word, you move over to the centre of the room and start to twirl around.
# Liona "Ooh, I see."
# s3_mc "Do you like it?"
# Liona "Like it?"
# Liona "I love it..."
# You start to remove your clothes, one piece at a time, until you're down to just your underwear.
# Liona "Tim could be back any minute!"
# s3_mc "Well you'd better hurry up and get over there then..."
# He pulls out a condom from his trouser pockets.
# You wink back at him.
# LI stands up and walks over to you.
# (if you coupled with each other on day 3 and did bits in the tent on day 4):
# bill "Remember the first time we made love?"
# Cam/AJ/harry "Remember the first time we got together?"
# B/H/Cam/aj "It seems like so long ago, but it was only last week."
# B/H/Cam/aj "I got to say, this is a much better space to have sex than a tent..."
# (if you did bits with Ciaran/Tai/Yasmin day 6 after the recoupling):
# C/T/yasmin "I'm still buzzing over how we hooked-up the night I picked you, by the way."
# C/T/yasmin "But unlike then, there's no nerves now."
# (no dialogue when MC is coupled with Rafi/Lily)
# [he_she] takes [his_her] finger and starts tracing down your back...
# s3_mc "Ooh..."
# Soon, [he_she] starts kissing your neck, before making [his_her] way further down.
# Down...
# Down...
# The two of you lie haphazardly redressed on the sofa, panting heavily.
# You're not sure how much time has gone by, but it couldn't have been long.
# Liona "That was incredible."
# Liona "Like you..."
# Just then, the door opens.

# Tim walks in carrying three glasses of what looks like water with some asparagus sticking out of them.
# Timiki "Alright, love birds? Big T's brought you some banging refreshments!"
# He looks up at the ceiling.(if you did bits)
# Timiki "How did the mirror get so steamed up?(if you did bits)"
# s3_mc "Oh, no reason.(if you did bits)"
# Liona "Wait, I asked for rum and coke?"
# Timiki "Yeah, I couldn't find either of them so I knocked this together..."
# Timiki "Let me know what you think, if it bangs I can make it my signature drink at my next gig."
# LI gingerly takes a cautious sip... and makes an awkward swallow.
# Liona "It's definitely got an interesting after taste."
# Timiki "That's what I'm going for, something unique innit."
# Liona "Oh it's unique alright!"
# You and LI chat to Tim for a while longer, just enjoying each other's company.
# Eventually, the evening winds down and all three of you leave the room.
# You bump into the others and decide to make your way to the bedroom as a group.(MC sticking with her former partner)
# You look for the others, but they're nowhere to be seen.(MC recoupling with Rafi/Lily)
# thought "May as well get ready for bed, then.(MC recoupling with Rafi/Lily)"

# You're the first one to make it back to the bedroom as the others head to the kitchen for some water and midnight snacks.
# You're still buzzing from everything that has happened, but reality hits home when you see Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ/Ciaran/Tai/Yasmin standing by [his_her] packed suitcase.
# B/H/Cam/AJ/C/T/yasmin "Oh..."
# B/H/Cam/AJ/C/T/yasmin "Hey."
# Choiceseb "It's just me and Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ/Ciaran/Tai/Yasmin alone in the bedroom..."
# -You're still here?
# B/H/Cam/AJ/C/T/yasmin "Want me gone so badly?"

# -Hey, babe
# C/T/yasmin "Oh, um, hey..."
# B/HCam/aj "No."
# B/HCam/aj "You don't get to 'babe' me anymore."

# -I can go if you like
# B/H/Cam/AJ/C/T/yasmin "No, don't worry. (you get 🙁 with Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ/Ciaran/ Tai/Yasmin)"

# [he_she] sighs. You see [his_her] eyes are red and puffy.
# B/H/Cam/AJ/C/T/yasmin "I actually wanted to be gone before any of you lot got back."
# B/H/Cam/AJ/C/T/yasmin "But packing took longer than I expected."
# [he_she] looks you straight in the eyes.
# (only coupled with former partner for the first time on day 9):
# B/H/AJ/C/T/Cam/yasmin "I guess getting dumped has made me a bit sluggish."
# B/H/AJ/C/T/Cam/yasmin "Thanks for that, by the way."
# (coupled with former partner more than once):
# B/H/AJ/C/T/Cam/yasmin "I guess having my heart ripped in two made me a bit sluggish."
# Choiceseb "That's..."
# -Not fair to say
# B/H/Cam/AJ/C/T/yasmin "Yeah, well, that's not the only thing that's unfair about this whole situation."

# -Just the way it is
# B/H/Cam/AJ/C/T/yasmin "Wow, really? Thanks for hammering that home as if I didn't realise that."

# -Fair. I'm sorry
# B/H/Cam/AJ/C/T/yasmin "Yeah, well, whatever..."

# You're suddenly aware of the sounds of the others outside.
# Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ/Ciaran/Tai/Yasmin picks up [his_her] bag and starts to make [his_her] way out of the room.
# B/H/Cam/AJ/C/T/yasmin "I don't want to see anyone else."
# B/H/Cam/AJ/C/T/yasmin "It's too embarrassing..."
# [he_she] stops by the bedroom door.
# Choiceseb "Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ/Ciaran/Tai/Yasmin is leaving..."
# -Tell [him_her] you made a mistake
# s3_mc "I shouldn't have asked Rafi/Lily to pick me..."
# s3_mc "I made a mistake."
# B/H/Cam/AJ/C/T/yasmin "Yeah, well, it's a bit late now, isn't it?"

# -Say nothing...
# You watch [him_her] as [he_she] walks past you.

# -Wish [him_her] well on the outside
# s3_mc "Hey, Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ/Ciaran/Tai/Yasmin..."
# s3_mc "I really do wish you all the best for out in the real world."
# [he_she] scoffs.

# Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ/Ciaran/ Tai/Yasmin rests [his_her] hand on the doorframe.
# B/H/Cam/AJ/C/T/yasmin "This whole thing really hurts, MC."
# B/H/Cam/AJ/C/T/yasmin "I cared so deeply for you."
# ciaran "Like, we weren't together in here all that long, but I was falling deep for you."
# B/H/Cam/AJ/C/T/yasmin "Maybe one day I'll be able to put this behind me and we can talk properly. But right now, everything's too raw."
# B/H/Cam/AJ/C/T/yasmin "Goodbye."
# [he_she] walks out, leaving you in the room alone.
# It's not long, however, before Rafi/Lily walks in.
# R/L: There you are, babe!
# R/L: Look at us, all alone in the bedroom together...
# [he_she] stops when [he_she] gets a look at your face properly.
# R/L: Everything alright?
# Choiceseb "Rafi/Lily wants to know if everything is OK..."
# -No, this night's been a lot
# -I just bumped into Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ/Ciaran/Tai/Yasmin
# R/L: Oh.
# R/L: That couldn't have been fun.
# s3_mc "Nope."
# R/L: Well, hey, you've got me now.
# R/L: And I'm here for you, babe. We'll see the rest of this through together.

# -Yeah, everything's fine
# He frowns.
# R/L: OK. If you say so...

# Just then, the rest of the Islanders burst into the bedroom. Nicky(L+N)/Elladine(E+R) trains in behind the others.
# (MC sticking with her former partner):
# You all enter the bedroom, still buzzing from the club night.
# Only Nicky and Elladine seem to lag behind the rest of you.
# M/iona "Anyone else notice the note on the hideaway door? It said 'VIP booth'?"
# seb "Is that where Tim went?"
# seb "I wanted him to sign my shirt."
# Liona "You might still get your chance."
# Liona "I think he's on the lawn practising his freestyling."
# You all go quiet and listen.
# Timiki "The name's Big T..."
# Timiki "But I ain't about to spill it..."
# Timiki "I'm about to flow it!"
# Timiki "And maybe if you're lucky..."
# Timiki "You'll get a go on my Big..."
# Someone coughs.
# M/iona "Wait, what was that last part? I didn't hear it."
# s3_mc "I think he said something about tea?"
# Liona "Nope, it was a letter that rhymes with T."
# M/iona "Oh?"
# M/iona "Oh!"
# M/iona "Ooh..."
# thought "Time to get out of this outfit. Think that's enough nineties for one night..."
# You slip away to get changed as the others chat.

# thought "After all the drama tonight, I should probably make an effort for LI."
# Outfit change to sleepwear
# thought "This should do the trick."
# thought "On second thoughts, this whole evening has been draining. I'm just gonna take it easy tonight."

# As you enter the bedroom, you see Nicky and Lily / Elladine and Rafi head over their now shared bed. Elladine (L+N) / Nicky (R+E) looks over at them from across the room.
# LI snaps you out of your thoughts.
# Liona "I love that number on you, MC. You're already making me so glad everything turned out the way it did."
# Liona "Not going to celebrate the fact we stayed together with something more interesting tonight?"
# LI. Doesn't matter, I can hardly complain, can I? What with how pretty you are.
# Liona "What are you thinking about?"
# Choiceseb "Just that I..."
# -Feel bad for Elladine (L+N) /Nicky (R+E)
# Rafi's/Lily's cheeks flush.(MC recoupled with Rafi/Lily)
# R/L: Yeah, that's got to be rough.(MC recoupled with Rafi/Lily)
# Liona "Yeah, I'd hate to be in that position.(MC sticking with former partner)"
# Liona "I still can't believe that Rafi/Lily chose to walk.(MC sticking with former partner)"

# -Can't believe all that happened tonight
# Liona "It was a lot."
# Liona "I think we'll be feeling it for the next few days."
# Liona "Unless some other massive thing happens."

# -Am so lucky to have you
# LI smiles at you.
# Liona "I'm lucky to have you, too. (you get 😍 with LI)"
# Liona "And that you stayed with me even though Rafi/Lily was grafting hard. (MC sticking with former partner)"
# R/L: And that you accepted me so late on in here... (MC recoupled with Rafi/Lily)

# You see Elladine(L+N) /Nicky (R+E) grab a pillow and pull it onto a cuddle.
# E(L+N) / N (R+E): Well, night all...
# N (L+N) / E (R+E): Goodnight, babe.

# "Another one bites the dust!"
# "And I did not see that coming..."
# "Guess I'll have to get rid of another sock puppet. Now one's missing its pair."
# "So thanks for that, Rafi/Lily. (MC sticking with former partner)"
# "So thanks for that, Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ/Ciaran/Tai/Yasmin (MC recoupling with Rafi/Lily)"
# "What? Yes I've made sock puppets of every Islander. How else am I meant to have social contact?"
# "You wouldn't believe what MC's been getting up during Shed Island..."
# "..."
# "Coming up!"
# "Will Tim wake the Islanders with a makeshift solo concert from the lawn in the morning?"
# "Spoiler alert!!! No, he won't."
# "But MC does wake up to something almost as strange..."
# Liona "Oops, that was me..."
# "And will breakfast in bed lead to... 'the thing'?"
# s3_mc "Yes, the thing! Absolutely."
# "Find out next time, on Love Island."

# "Welcome back..."
# "To Love Island!"
# "I can't believe the Islanders got to meet Tim last night."
# "I should have asked someone to get me his autograph..."
# "I want to add it to my shrine, er, display of Love Island memorabilia."
# "The autographs would look really nice next to my framed selfie with Mason and my signed pair of Bobby cake shorts."
# "Oh, and there was the small issue of the surprise recoupling."
# (MC recoupled with Rafi/Lily):
# "We saw some seismic shifts in the Villa."
# "MC and Rafi/Lily rose like a mountain range... whilst Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ/ Ciaran/Tai/Yasmin was swallowed by magma."
# "Not literally, obviously, since the producers haven't returned my calls about my concept for Danger Island."
# (MC sticking with former partner):
# "MC and Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ/Ciaran/Tai/Yasmin managed to weather the storm and came out stronger than ever."
# "Bye, Rafi/Lily. We barely know ya."
# "Where do we go from here, you ask?"
# "Well, what do most people do after a hard break-up or falling-out?"
# "Personally, I sleep in until the afternoon and then eat lots of comfort food."

# You wake up to find LI's arm draped over you.
# [his_her] chest gently rises and falls, and [he_she] makes a small half-asleep sound of contentment.
# Choiceseb "LI looks so peaceful..."
# -Watch [him_her] sleep
# LI stirs a little.
# Liona "And the winner of Love Island is..."
# thought "He's/She's talking in [his_her] sleep!"
# Liona "...Mr Blobby and Noel Edmonds..."
# Liona "No... That should be me and Mr Blobby..."
# LI wakes up suddenly.
# Liona "I had the weirdest dream."
# s3_mc "I know."
# Liona "Oh no. What did I say?"
# s3_mc "I'm sorry you didn't win Love Island, babe."
# Liona "Oh no..."

# -Squeeze [him_her] closer
# You roll your body so you and LI are pressed chest-to-chest.
# [his_her] skin is warm and you can feel [his_her] heart beating softly. You put your arm around [him_her] and pull [him_her] closer.
# LI stirs, and opens [his_her] eyes.
# Liona "Hey there, you."
# [he_she] lightly touches the side of your face. (Bill/Harry)
# [he_she] leans in and nuzzles his nose against yours. (Camilo/AJ/Ciaran/Tai/Rafi/Lily)
# Liona "You're great."

# -Wake [him_her] up obnoxiously
# You lean in and put your lips close to [his_her] ear and blow a loud raspberry.
# [he_she] jerks awake suddenly.
# Liona "Whaa?!"
# s3_mc "Your face!"
# Liona "Hey!"
# s3_mc "Want another one?"
# Liona "Have mercy!"

# The two of you lie back and both let out a contented sigh. You look over at [him_her].

# Choiceseb "What should I do now I've got him/ alone?"
# -Kiss him hard and fast
# You pull his head towards you and kiss him passionately.
# He responds enthusiastically, his hands roaming your body like he can't get enough of you.
# Bill wraps his arms around your waist and smiles. You rest your head on his chest.

# -Kiss him sweet and slow
# You gently brush your lips against his and move your mouth across his skin, planting small kisses down his neck.
# He reaches up and strokes your cheek with his calloused fingers.
# Bill wraps his arms around your waist and smiles. You rest your head on his chest.

# -Playfully wind [him_her] up
# You lean as if you're going to kiss his neck, but move your lips to his ear.
# s3_mc "The Expendables are rubbish."
# bill "You've got to be kidding!"
# bill "It's a bloody trave-"
# He sees your cheeky grin.
# bill "Oh, you were winding me up. Good job."
# bill "Either I'm predictable or you've gotten to know me really well."
# You put your arms around him and give him a squeeze.
# s3_mc "Little from column A, a little from column B... mostly column A!"

# bill "Us lads were talking the other day and a question came up that got me thinking."
# s3_mc "What was it?"
# bill "What's the thing in your life you're proudest of?"
# s3_mc "That's easy."
# bill "Go on then."
# Choiceseb "What's my greatest accomplishment?"
# -Climbing Mount Everest
# bill "Seriously?"
# s3_mc "Well... only sort of."
# s3_mc "It was a model of Mount Everest on a local miniature golf course."
# bill "I see..."
# s3_mc "It was pretty big, though! Took some doing."
# bill "Why did you climb it?"
# Choiceseb "Why did I climb the fake Mount Everest?"
# -Because it was there
# You shrug.
# s3_mc "Nobody had ever done it before."
# bill "Impressive. Did you put a flag on top?"
# s3_mc "Not quite. But I did write my initials in a discrete spot."

# -Because a cat was stuck on it
# s3_mc "I could hear it meowing, and I never leave an animal in distress."
# bill "But you managed to rescue it in the end?"
# s3_mc "It turned out to just be a mechanical yeti that needed oiling."
# s3_mc "But I made it up the mountain, and that's the main thing."

# -Because I hated the owner of the miniature golf course
# s3_mc "He was really mean to a friend of mine, so I climbed the mountain and stole a mechanical yeti from the top."
# s3_mc "It's not really justice, but it made her feel better."
# bill "Do you still have the yeti?"
# s3_mc "You bet. I wanted to bring it to the Villa, but it didn't fit in my suitcase."
# bill "Maybe I'll get to see it one day?"
# s3_mc "Maybe you will."

# -Succeeding at being a scientist/model/pro athlete/musician
# s3_mc "It was a real ambition of mine, and it took a lot of blood, sweat and tears to make it."
# s3_mc "I'm proud of how far I've come."
# bill "You should be!"
# bill "I always wanted to be a roofer. My old man was a plumber, but I didn't fancy sticking my hands down peoples' drains."
# bill "Being a good roofer takes effort, but anyone can become one."
# bill "So I'm always impressed by people who've had to work just to start their career."

# -Making the world's greatest cheese toastie
# bill "Bold claim."
# s3_mc "It's really not. I make the best cheese toastie you could ever dream of."
# bill "With mayo instead of butter?"
# s3_mc "Of course."
# bill "And a mixture of mature cheddar and edam?"
# s3_mc "Wow, yes! I call it the MC Special."
# bill "Wow. Maybe you do make the best cheese toastie in the world."

# s3_mc "So, what are you proudest of?"
# bill "Hmm. It's hard to pick, but if we're talking recently, there's an obvious choice."
# bill "Coming here."
# bill "I don't know if you noticed, but I can be a little bit... set in my ways."
# s3_mc "You? Never!"
# bill "Yeah, yeah. Anyway, I decided that I was in a rut, so I did the most un-me thing I could think of."
# He squeezes you and plants a kiss on your forehead.
# bill "I was terrified if I'm honest, but it turns out it was a very good decision."
# bill "I can't believe we made it this far. It's so close to the end. Did you think we'd make it?"
# Choiceseb "Did I think Bill and I would make it to the final?"
# -It's no big deal
# -We were meant to be
# s3_mc "We were always going to come out of this together."
# bill "I like that."

# -It came as a surprise
# s3_mc "I wasn't really sure what to expect."
# s3_mc "But I wasn't expecting this."

# Harry smothers down his hair, but a bit of it still sticks up.
# s3_mc "You've got a bit sticking out there."
# Harry runs his hand over the completely wrong bit of his head.
# harry "Did I get it?"
# s3_mc "No. Here, let me."
# You deal with the offending piece of hair, but then you realise how close you are
# Choiceseb "What should I do?"
# -Muss up his hair
# -Pat him on the head
# -Kiss him
# You thread your hand through his hair and lean in to kiss him. His lips are warm and sweet.
# harry "You're lovely."
# harry "I like how you always do little things like that."
# s3_mc "I couldn't let you wander about with a hair out of place now could I?"
# harry "Well you make me feel, I dunno, looked after."

# You give him a great big cuddle and luxuriate for a moment in amiable silence.
# harry "Hey, MC, can I tell you something?"
# s3_mc "Of course."
# He gives you a cheeky smile.
# harry "Being with you always makes me feel like a winner."
# Choiceseb "Harry feels like a winner with me..."
# -Don't get too focused on winning
# -Does that make me the brains of the operation?
# -I feel like a winner too!
# s3_mc "I reckon we're in it to win it."
# harry "I'm glad you feel the same."

# harry "Even in care, I always had a hustle, nothing could really keep me down."
# harry "And being with you, I feel like we could do anything."
# s3_mc "Well, I wouldn't have you any other way."
# harry "There you go again, saying all the right things, being lovely."
# s3_mc "I mean it."
# harry "Well...thanks...It means a lot that you like me just the way I am."
# harry "I can't believe we made it this far. It's so close to the end. Did you think we'd make it?"

# You look down for a second. When you look back up, Camilo is staring intensely right at you.
# Choiceseb "Camilo is looking at me. I should..."
# -Stare right back
# -Stick your tongue out
# -Kiss him
# You seize the initiative and kiss him, hard and fast. He's taken aback for a moment, but he recovers and returns the kiss with passion.
# He runs his strong hands down your body.
# camilo "That was pretty sexy."
# camilo "I was just about to kiss you myself!"

# camilo "Would you call yourself a competitive person, MC?"
# Choiceseb "Am I competitive?"
# -Yes, it's a way of life
# -Not really
# -Only when it comes to sports and games
# s3_mc "Just a little."
# s3_mc "But only when I'm actually competing!"
# s3_mc "Off the field, I'm nice as pie."
# camilo "And just as sweet."
# He winks.
# s3_mc "You're terrible!"

# s3_mc "What about you, then? You must be quite competitive."
# s3_mc "Jiu jitsu, dating..."
# camilo "Dating's not a competition, MC."
# camilo "Not when you look this good, anyway."
# s3_mc "Haha."
# camilo "Seriously, though. I love sports, but I'm not one of these people who has to win all the time."
# s3_mc "Yeah. With some people, it's less that they wanna win and more that they just want to see everyone lose."
# Camilo rubs his chin. He looks thoughtful.
# camilo "I guess I'm kind of the opposite of that."
# s3_mc "How do you mean?"
# camilo "I like helping other people achieve stuff they wanna do."
# camilo "I've got this mate called Spoonface. Sorry, Pete."
# s3_mc "Let me guess... he used a spoon once?"
# camilo "How did you know? He didn't have a fork so he used a spoon to eat his chips."
# s3_mc "Hashtag bants."
# camilo "So anyway, Pete wanted to open his own gym."
# camilo "But he had no idea about all the paperwork and tax stuff you need to do to have your own place."
# camilo "I really enjoyed helping him out with it."
# camilo "Well, I say helping. I did most of it."
# Choiceseb "Camilo helped his friend set up a gym..."
# -Isn't that a lot of work for you?
# -I hope he was grateful!
# -You're such a nice person
# s3_mc "How are you so lovely?"
# camilo "It's just what you do for your mates, innit?"

# s3_mc "You go above and beyond, though."
# s3_mc "You put other people ahead of yourself a lot, did you know that?"
# camilo "Yeah, I know."
# camilo "Sometimes I do wish I could put myself first a bit more."
# camilo "But having my friends be happy makes me happy, you feel me?"
# camilo "So what am I meant to do?"
# s3_mc "That's a tricky one. I can't tell you how to live your life."
# He smiles, and puts his arms around you.
# camilo "I appreciate it."
# He sighs.
# camilo "I love being here with you. I don't want it to end."
# You nuzzle against him, and he squeezes you tighter.
# camilo "I can't believe we made it this far. It's so close to the end. Did you think we'd make it?"
# Choiceseb "Did I think Camilo and I would make it to the final?"
# -It's no big deal

# AJ grins at you.
# aj "Bet you can't guess what I'm thinking..."
# Choiceseb "What do I think AJ is thinking?"
# -A number from one to ten
# -That she wants a cuddle
# She smiles.
# aj "Pretty close."
# aj "I was thinking that I really wanted to, like..."
# aj "Kiss you..."

# -That she wants to kiss me
# She points up.
# aj "Ding ding! We have a winner."

# Choiceseb "AJ wants to kiss me..."
# -Not right now, thanks
# -What are you waiting for? Kiss me!
# aj "OK!"
# She leans in and your lips meet.
# It's soft at first, but gradually the pressure builds.
# She takes your hand in hers and squeezes it lightly as you start to kiss more heavily.
# After a few hot minutes, you pull away.
# aj "Wow!"
# aj "You're such an awesome kisser."
# s3_mc "You're not too bad yourself, gorgeous."

# AJ suddenly sighs.
# aj "I totally forgot but I was also thinking about this other thing actually."
# aj "That I was hoping we could, like, chat about."
# s3_mc "What other thing?"
# aj "Like, when we're out of here..."
# aj "And we're back in the usual back and forth of real life stuff..."
# s3_mc "Yeah..."
# aj "Do you think you'll still find me exciting?"
# aj "Or do you think you'll be bored of me?"
# Choiceseb "Will I be bored of AJ?"
# -Things will inevitably different
# -No way José
# aj "Thanks, MC. (you get 😍 with AJ)"
# aj "Obviously, like, same goes for you..."

# -You are more fun than anyone
# aj "Thanks, MC. (you get 😍 with AJ)"
# aj "Obviously, like, same goes for you..."

# aj "Hence why I'm worrying."
# aj "I've never felt this with someone before."
# aj "I know I spoke about, like, getting bored and stuff in relationships before..."
# aj "But I'm starting to realise something."
# s3_mc "What's on your mind?"
# aj "Well, I think I always used to stop things quickly before they got too serious."
# aj "I think I was just, like, a little nervous that I would be boring them."
# aj "Because I'm not, like, super brainy like other people."
# aj "And I used to worry that it would make me kind of boring."
# AJ sighs.
# Choiceseb "AJ is worried people find her boring..."
# -Maybe you should watch some quiz shows
# -You don't need to be clever to be a good person
# aj "I guess you're right."

# -You're so adorable, no one could ever find you boring!
# AJ smiles. (you get 😍 with AJ)
# aj "Thanks babe."

# aj "I don't usually overthink things like this."
# aj "But you've got me, like, totally questioning everything."
# aj "You've given me all these feels and emotions and honestly I don't know where to put them."
# aj "Thanks for talking to me about it though."
# s3_mc "It's alright, hun."
# s3_mc "Any time."
# aj "I can't believe we made it this far. It's so close to the end. Did you think we'd make it?"
# Choiceseb "Did I think AJ and I would make it to the final?"
# -It's no big deal
# -We were meant to be

# Tai leans in close to you, almost, but not quite touching you.
# The heat of his body is nothing compared to the warmth of his smile.
# tai "Fancy a little kiss?"
# Choiceseb "Would I like Tai to kiss me?"
# -I'm not in the mood
# -I'd like him to tease me instead
# s3_mc "How about you take it slow instead?"
# tai "Ooh, sounds fun."
# Tai leans close, looking deep into your eyes and his lips close to yours, still not quite touching you.
# You gaze at each other for several heartbeats. Tai's eyes crinkle as he tries to stop himself from smiling.
# His breath catches, just a little, and then he pulls back.
# tai "Whew, can't handle that anymore."

# -I'd love it
# s3_mc "Sounds like a plan."
# Tai's smile broadens to a grin. He puts his hand on each side of your face and kisses you deeply, as though drinking you in.
# Your body fits with his perfectly, and you find your thoughts melting away.
# When you draw apart, you feel almost dizzy with sensations.
# tai "Whew, you feel amazing."

# He stretches contentedly, looking a little like a happy, sleepy cat. When he speaks, his voice is soft.
# tai "If you were anywhere other than here, where would you be?"
# Choices:
# -Somewhere calm and beautiful
# -Somewhere exciting and bustling
# s3_mc "There'd be a ton of shops and nightlife!"
# tai "Mmm, and I'd take you to a fancy restaurant."
# tai "Probably throw half my dinner over my shirt."
# s3_mc "Who says you'd be wearing a shirt?"
# tai "Shirtless dinner it is."

# -I'd be right here with you
# tai "But I'm meant to be the most adorable! (you get 😍 with Tai)"
# tai "Never mind. It's a close call."
# tai "Obviously it's amazing being here, but..."

# While stroking your arm, Tai considers thoughtfully for a few minutes.
# Then he nods.
# tai "If I wasn't here, I'd want to swim with dolphins."
# s3_mc "You like dolphins?"
# tai "What's not to like?"
# tai "They're cute, pretty sure they're bi, they're playful, they hang out with their mates all the time."
# tai "Plus, if you're a dolphin, you get to chill out in the water all day. Good times."
# thought "Is Tai saying he wants to swim with dolphins or be a dolphin?"
# tai "And they do that cool leaping thing."
# He gestures with his hand, imitating the arc of a dolphin's leap.
# It's less accurate, but full of enthusiasm.
# Choiceseb "Tai definitely wants to be a dolphin..."
# -I'll stay human, thanks
# s3_mc "How would you talk if you were a dolphin?"
# s3_mc "We wouldn't be able to chill together."
# tai "Dolphins can talk. They just do this..."
# Tai makes a quiet, squeaky dolphin noise, then starts laughing.
# Once he calms down, he carries on stroking your arm gently, then leans down to kiss your palm.

# -I'd be a dolphin too
# s3_mc "I bet we'd make a good dolphin couple."
# Tai makes a quiet, squeaky dolphin noise, then starts laughing. (you get 😍 with Tai)
# Once he calms down, he carries on stroking your arm gently, then leans down to kiss your palm.

# -You should be a different animal
# s3_mc "You know dolphins can be kind of mean?"
# tai "No way. Really?"
# s3_mc "Don't blame me, blame the dolphins."
# tai "No way am I being a mean animal. I'll have to choose another one."
# He carries on stroking your arm gently, then leans down to kiss your palm.

# tai "I think really, though, I'd  be here with you."
# tai "I used to spend quite a bit of time wondering what things would have been like in another universe."
# tai "It wasn't a great thing to think about."
# Choiceseb "Tai used to have regrets... (no further reactions)"
# -That sounds hard
# -But you're successful
# -What weren't you happy about?

# s3_mc "Did you regret things a lot?"
# Tai smiles and strokes your cheek.
# tai "I know how lucky I am."
# tai "And I did then, too."
# tai "But part of me always wondered if I could've gone further with rugby."
# Choiceseb "I'd imagine going to the top and picture what it'd be like."
# -Best not to dwell on it
# -Then you wouldn't be in the Villa!
# s3_mc "You'd be running laps in London instead of chilling here."
# tai "Oh, I wouldn't want that."
# tai "It's much warmer here, for one thing."
# tai "I feel better about the career stuff now."

# -It's good to have ambition
# s3_mc "Having goals is a good thing."
# tai "Yeah, and scoring them too."
# tai "But not if the goals bring you down."
# tai "I feel better about it now."

# tai "I hadn't even thought about it till I realised I hadn't been thinking about it."
# s3_mc "What changed?"
# tai "Coming here."
# tai "You."
# tai "And seeing how funny you look when you do this face."
# He puts on a wide-eyed shocked face.
# s3_mc "I don't make that face!"
# tai "You so do."
# s3_mc "..."
# s3_mc "Rude."
# tai "So here we are. Did you see yourself with someone else this close to the end?"
# Choiceseb "Did I see myself changing partners so close to the end?"
# -It's no big deal
# -We were meant to be
# s3_mc "I feel like I spent my whole time in here waiting for you."
# tai "How do you think I felt waiting to come in and meet you?"

# -You swept me off my feet
# s3_mc "You took me by surprise."
# tai "A good surprise, I hope."
# s3_mc "A very good surprise."

# Suddenly, Ciaran approaches you, brushing your hair back from your head.
# He smiles, looking at your mouth.
# s3_mc "Choiceseb "I think he's going to kiss me!""
# -Step back
# -Let him
# You smile at him. He smiles back, and kisses you, softly, then harder, more confidently.
# Your hand trails down his back and he pulls you closer by the small of your back.
# Your bodies meet in a strip of warmth, your hair tangled up in his fingers.
# When he steps back, you see his mouth is stained with lipstick and his pupils are huge.
# s3_mc "Well, I definitely didn't expect that."
# ciaran "You make me brave, MC."

# ciaran "I just get this really protective urge around you."
# ciaran "Obviously there's nothing dangerous here, but I just always want to be close to you, in case anything happens."
# s3_mc "Like a bodyguard?"
# ciaran "Kind of!"
# ciaran "People do weird things, MC. I've seen some things on the job."
# ciaran "Like a lad at the club who downed two vodka cranberries and tried to fight me with a plastic sword."
# ciaran "He was covered in foam from the cannon, too, and wearing red, so he looked like a drunk Santa."
# s3_mc "How did it end?"
# Ciaran rolls his eyes.
# ciaran "Well, while he was running towards me he slipped over on the foam, right out of the club."
# ciaran "I just opened the door and he slid."
# s3_mc "So if someone came for me, you'd jump in front of them?"
# ciaran "Without hesitation."
# Choiceseb "That's so..."
# -Sexist
# -Silly
# -Sexy
# s3_mc "Thinking about you defending my honour, getting into fights for me... that's hot."
# ciaran "Don't be getting into any trouble, now."
# s3_mc "I might have to, just to watch you get all sweaty."

# ciaran "I had to protect my mum from a dog at the park once. I was only 16."
# ciaran "Ever since then, I guess I'm a little paranoid about the ones I care about."
# s3_mc "I'm sorry that happened."
# s3_mc "Wasn't your dad around?"
# ciaran "My dad left when I was two."
# ciaran "I haven't seen him since then."
# ciaran "But my mum is amazing. She's never made me feel like there was any kind of hole there."
# s3_mc "She sounds like a great woman."
# s3_mc "Think she'll like me?"
# ciaran "Oh, definitely! You're smart, you're kind, you like me. That's all she's ever wanted!"
# ciaran "Would you want to meet her? When we get out of here?"
# Choiceseb "Do I want to meet Ciaran's mum?"
# -Some day, sure
# -It's too soon
# -Yes!
# s3_mc "I'd love to. I bet she has all sorts of stories about you."
# s3_mc "And I have to see the baby pictures..."
# ciaran "Oh, on second thought..."
# s3_mc "No, you already suggested it! It's agreed. Done deal."
# ciaran "OK. Think before I speak next time. Lesson learned."

# He takes your hand.
# ciaran "You know, I'm just about ready to get out of here."
# ciaran "I've found what I came here for."
# ciaran "Now it's just a matter of enjoying the sunshine."
# Choiceseb "Ciaran said he's found what he came for!"
# -That's intense
# -Yeah, Tai's great
# -I have too
# s3_mc "I've found what I came for, too."
# ciaran "I can't wait to take you home with me. (you get ❤️ with Ciaran)"

# s3_mc "What's the weather like in Waterford?"
# ciaran "Oh, it's terrible. In the summer it only gets to, like, 16 celsius."
# s3_mc "Why are you smiling then?"
# ciaran "It's wonderful! You don't like the cold?"
# Choiceseb "The cold is..."
# -Awful!
# -Great!
# s3_mc "I love it. You get so many outfit choices."
# s3_mc "Scarves, hats, gloves, boots, jackets..."
# s3_mc "In the summer it's like, pick a top and a bottom and out you go."
# ciaran "Exactly!"

# -OK for half the year
# s3_mc "It has time and place."
# s3_mc "But I wouldn't want to be cold all the time."
# s3_mc "Summer is meant to be hot!"
# ciaran "That's a fair point. There's always tanning beds!"

# ciaran "So here we are. Did you see yourself with someone else this close to the end?"
# Choiceseb "Did I see myself changing partners so close to the end?"
# -It's no big deal

# ciaran "A good surprise, I hope."
# s3_mc "A very good surprise."

# s3_mc "So..."
# s3_mc "Have you made any more progress with that song?"
# yasmin "I'm glad you asked!"
# yasmin "I've been working on it in my head whenever I get a minute to myself. Which isn't much around here, but still."
# Choiceseb "Yasmin's still writing that song for me in her head..."
# -There is no song, is there?
# -But I wanna hear it right now!
# -There's no need to rush it
# s3_mc "Take as long as you need to get it right."
# yasmin "Thanks for being so patient. The lyrics are still a long way from ready."

# yasmin "But the melody is there now, if you'd like to hear it."
# She closes her eyes and starts to softly hum a melody.
# It's slow and sweet, with just a note of melancholy. It definitely sounds like a love song.
# When it's over, she opens her eyes and looks at you nervously.
# yasmin "What do you think?"
# Choiceseb "The melody of Yasmin's song..."
# -I'm more interested in the words
# -It's absolutely beautiful, babe
# She blushes.
# yasmin "I'm so glad you like it. (you get 😍 with Yasmin)"

# -Do it again and i'll add a harmony (MC's career is musician)
# yasmin "Are you sure?"
# s3_mc "Yeah! I'm a musician too, remember? Come on, it'll be easy."
# Keeping her eyes open and fixed on you this time, she starts humming the tune again.
# After a moment, you join in, complementing her melody with a close harmony.
# When it's over, Yasmin stares at you.
# yasmin "I felt a shiver go down my spine. (you get 😍 with Yasmin)"
# s3_mc "Me too."
# yasmin "It means a lot to me that this is something we can share."

# yasmin "The truth is, my music is sometimes the only way I can be fully open about my feelings."
# yasmin "I know I can be a bit... closed off sometimes."
# yasmin "But I don't want to be closed off to you. I want us to be able to really connect and share the same energy."
# yasmin "That's partly why I have to write this song. To make sure we're truly on the same wavelength."
# Choiceseb "She wants us to be on the same wavelength"
# -Isn't 'wavelength' something to do with radios?
# -Reassure her with a kiss
# You press your lips to hers.
# You can feel her smiling as she kisses you back, entwining her fingers with yours.
# s3_mc "Now, did that feel like two people sharing a wavelength to you?"
# yasmin "It did. (you get 😍 with Yasmin)"

# -Give her a hug
# You wrap your arm around her shoulders. She cuddles up to you gratefully. (you get 😍 with Yasmin)

# yasmin "So here we are. Did you see yourself with someone else this close to the end?"
# Choiceseb "Did I see myself changing partners so close to the end?"

# Rafi gives you a dazzling smile, then leans close enough that you feel the warmth of his arm against yours.
# His gaze drifts to your mouth.
# R: I'd very much like to kiss you.
# Choiceseb "Rafi would like to kiss me..."
# -Tell him I'm not in the mood right now
# -Play hard to get
# s3_mc "You'll have to catch me first!"
# You duck sideways, laughing, and Rafi mock-pouts. When you let him catch you, he kisses you passionately.
# His deft fingers slide over your hair, sending tingles all down your neck.

# -Kiss him first
# s3_mc "I'll get you first!"
# You lunge forward, catching Rafi by surprise. He makes the most undignified yelp you've heard from him.
# Leaning in, you kiss him passionately, feeling every sensation shivering over your skin.
# Rafi's deft fingers slide over your hair, sending tingles all down your neck.
# When you draw apart, his breath catches.

# Rafi absent-mindedly rubs his cheek, then runs a fingertip along the sharp line of his beard.
# R: Hmm, is the line quite right?
# Choiceseb "Rafi's concerned about his beard..."
# -Tease him
# -Reassure him
# s3_mc "Your beard's great."
# s3_mc "the way it frames your face... it's perfect."
# R: Babe, you're too kind. (you get 😍 with Rafi)

# -Kiss him
# You pout thoughtfully, then lean very close to Rafi, almost touching him.
# s3_mc "Let's have a look."
# You trace the line of Rafi's beard with your lips. He smells faintly of rose. He's very still, taking cues from you.
# s3_mc "Maybe I should do a closer assessment."
# Rafi's breath catches.
# R: Oh, always.
# You take control, kissing him deeply until your lips are tingling.
# When you draw back, Rafi cocks his head cheekily.
# R: You're the best barber I've ever visited.

# Rafi grins at you.
# R: My brother's always saying I fuss over my beard too much.
# R: Once he hid my shaving cream so I'd let him have the last baklava.
# R: It was a very good baklava.
# Choiceseb "Rafi's brother stole his shaving cream over baklava..."
# -What's baklava?
# -I'd do the same
# s3_mc "Baklava is lush. I'm on his side."
# R: I can't believe you're ganging up on me when you haven't even met! (you get 😂 with Rafi)

# -Outrageous!
# s3_mc "That's so mean!"
# R: I might have done the same, to be honest. I really mean it when I say how good it was.

# s3_mc "So did you give it to him?"
# R: Of course! I couldn't go a day without keeping this up.
# He pouts at an imaginary camera, then frames his beard with his fingers.
# R: Besides... I want to look good for you.
# R: Well, for me. But also for you.
# His fingers skim lightly over your skin. When he speaks, his voice is soft and husky.
# R: Your moves at the club were stunning.
# R: I'm used to being the best dancer in the room, but you're something else.
# R: Do you... take the lead when you're dancing? Or do you follow?
# Choiceseb "Rafi's asking if I take the lead when I dance..."
# -I like to follow someone's lead
# -I'm a dominant type
# s3_mc "Being in charge is my thing."
# s3_mc "I like taking the lead."
# R: Ooh, now that sounds interesting.

# -I'm... flexible
# s3_mc "I could go either way, depending how I'm feeling."
# s3_mc "It's all good."
# R: Mm, now that sounds like fun.

# R: I can't say I've had much experience being bossed around...
# R: ...but I certainly would try it out with you.
# R: And I love treating a girl like a princess.
# Rafi leans close and kisses you on the cheek. His stubble rubs lightly on your skin.
# R: Now we're definitely not talking about dancing, are we?
# s3_mc "Mm, no, I don't think we are."
# Rafi's voice sends shivers down your spine as he murmurs close to your skin.
# R: I look forward to chatting more about this later.
# R: So here we are. Did you see yourself with someone else this close to the end?
# Choiceseb "Did I see myself changing partners so close to the end?"
# -It's no big deal
# -We were meant to be
# s3_mc "I feel like I spent my whole time in here waiting for you."
# R: How do you think I felt waiting to come in and meet you?

# -You swept me off my feet
# s3_mc "You took me by surprise."
# R: A good surprise, I hope.
# s3_mc "A very good surprise."

# Lily leans closer, her body radiating heat. Holding your gaze, she flickers her tongue over her teeth.
# L: How about I kiss you right now?
# Choiceseb "Would I like Lily to kiss me?"
# -Play hard to get
# -Tell her I'm not in the mood right now
# -Get in and kiss her first
# s3_mc "Or how about I get in there first?"
# You dart forward and catch Lily on the side of her mouth. She squeaks and manoeuvres you into a better position.
# You kiss her deeply, savouring every sensation of her body against yours.
# Lily's hands rest confidently on your hips. When she draws back, her cheeks are flushed.

# She takes your hands, and examines them gently.
# L: Your hands are gorge. I love looking at them.
# s3_mc "Seems like you enjoy feeling them, too."
# L. Oh, yes. Yes, I do.
# L: I like feeling all of you.
# She grins, and lets your hands drop.
# For a moment, her gaze shifts away from you.
# L: My ex once said I was too full on.
# She scowls at the memory, and sighs.
# L: But I'd rather let someone know when I like them.
# Choiceseb "Someone told Lily she was too full on..."
# -Don't change for a partner
# -You're great the way you are
# -If someone's not right for you, that's OK
# s3_mc "Maybe your ex wasn't the right person for you."
# s3_mc "And that's OK."
# s3_mc "You're not gonna be everyone's cup of tea."
# L: Yeah, that's true.
# L: I'll be someone else's tall drink of water instead.

# L: And...
# Lily leans in close to your neck. Her breath is warm and her soft lips very nearly touch your skin.
# L: ...no one else has complained about me being bossy.
# L: Unless you prefer being the one in charge?
# Choiceseb "Lily's wondering if I like to take charge"
# -I'm well up for being in charge
# -I'd rather follow someone's lead
# -I'm... flexible
# s3_mc "For me it's a little from column A, and a little from column B."
# s3_mc "Sometimes I'm in the mood for chilling out..."
# s3_mc "...sometimes it's time to put my stomping boots on, you know?"
# L: Ooh, both of them sound fun.

# L: I love treating a girl like a princess, but I could treat you like a queen, too.
# L: Your Majesty.
# As she strokes your cheek and draws close, you can almost taste the smoky musk of Lily's perfume.
# The smoulder in her gaze sends a shiver down your spine. When she speaks, her voice is low and rough.
# L: I'm looking forward to... discussing this more with you later.
# L: So here we are. Did you see yourself with someone else this close to the end?
# Choiceseb "Did I see myself changing partners so close to the end?"
# -It's no big deal
# -We were meant to be
# s3_mc "I feel like I spent my whole time in here waiting for you."
# L: How do you think I felt waiting to come in and meet you?

# -You swept me off my feet
# s3_mc "You took me by surprise."
# L: A good surprise, I hope.
# s3_mc "A very good surprise."

# Liona "Do you ever think about what it'll be like to go back to the real world?"
# Choiceseb "Yeah, of course."
# -It'll be nice to go home
# s3_mc "I can't wait to sleep in my own bed."
# Liona "I feel the same way..."
# T/C/aj "I'm looking forward to it so much."
# B/H/Cam/Y/R/L: I can't wait to sleep in your own bed either.
# s3_mc "Cheeky!"
# Liona "It would be nice if you were there, though."

# -I'm ready for my next adventure
# Liona "Wow, you never stop, do you?"
# Liona "It's very cool."

# -I'm going to miss everyone in here
# Liona "Me too."
# Liona "But I'm definitely going to see some of them again."
# R/L: Even though I came in pretty late, I feel like I've made some solid friends.

# LI props himself/herself up on one elbow and looks at you with a smile.
# Liona "So what does the future hold for you?"
# Choiceseb "What am I planning to do in the future?"
# -I'm going to start a business (Yasmin's missing)
# AJ/ciaran "Nice."
# AJ/ciaran "I don't think I could do that."
# B/H/Cam/T/R/L: That's a great idea!
# B/H/Cam/T/R/L: I was thinking of maybe starting something up myself.
# B/H/Cam/T/R/L: We'll see, I guess.

# -I'm going to go travelling
# tai "That's a really great idea."
# tai "I'd love to do a bit of that myself, if I could find the time."
# tai "Maybe South America..."
# Liona "Nice, you go! (except Tai)"
# Liona "I'm not sure I could find the time for it myself. (except Tai)"

# -I want to get married and have kids
# yasmin "That's really nice."
# yasmin "I don't think I'm there yet, but maybe someday."
# Liona "I feel the same way. All this is so nice... (except Yasmin)"
# [he_she] gestures around the room.
# Liona "But I don't want to live this life forever. I couldn't."
# s3_mc "Me neither."

# The conversation is interrupted by a loud gurgling sound.
# s3_mc "What was that?"
# Liona "Oops, that was me..."
# Liona "Or at least, my stomach..."
# s3_mc "I'm hungry too!"
# s3_mc "Why don't I make you breakfast in bed? It can be like a date."
# Liona "A date? I like that. You'd do that for me? (you get 😍 with LI)"
# Choiceseb "[he_she] seems pretty happy that I said I'd make breakfast in bed..."
# -Anything for you, babe
# s3_mc "Absolutely."
# You tap [him_her] on the nose.
# s3_mc "Wait right here."

# -I was going to make breakfast for myself anyway
# Liona "As long as it's no trouble."
# s3_mc "None at all. I'll be back in a jiffy."

# -You're gonna owe me big time
# Liona "You best get thinking about what you want in return, then."
# s3_mc "I've got a couple of ideas."

# You get out of bed and head down to the kitchen.

# Choiceseb "What should I make?"
# -Buttered toast
# thought "I'll keep it nice and simple."
# You locate bread and butter, and before long you've got two plates of hot, buttery toast.

# -Fruit salad
# thought "Classic and healthy."
# You neatly chop up some strawberries, mango, and pineapple and pop it in a bowl.

# -Cereal and milk
# thought "I'm sure LI will like this."
# You pick a cereal you think he'll/she'll like, pour it out, and splash ice-cold milk on it.

# Choiceseb "Hmm, needs a little extra oomph..."
# -Add jam
# You dig out a jar of strawberry jam and apply it liberally.

# -Add chocolate sauce
# You find a small bottle of chocolate sauce and apply it liberally.

# -Add fruit
# You find some melon in the fridge, cut it up, and arrange it on top.
# s3_mc "Can't have too much fruit in a fruit salad."

# (toast with fruits/chocolate sauce, cereals with jam):
# thought "Hmm.. I'm not sure about this..."
# thought "What am I saying? This is perfect. It works, right?"
# thought "This is going to be so good. LI will love it. "
# LI comes downstairs. [his_her] hair is tousled and he's/she's still in [his_her] pajamas.
# Choiceseb "Wow..."
# -I was hoping for formalwear
# [he_she] gives you a sidelong glance, and then sees your smile.
# Liona "You very almost had me going there."
 
# -Wasn't it going to be breakfast in bed?
# [he_she] pretends to clutch [his_her] heart.
# Liona "I just couldn't spend another moment apart."

# -You look so hot
# [he_she] grins, and runs a hand through [his_her] hair.
# Liona "You too, babe."

# [he_she] wraps [his_her] arms around you from behind and looks over your shoulder.
# Liona "So what are we having?"
# s3_mc "I made us some cereal/toast/fruit!"
# You put the cereal/toast/fruit on the table.
# Liona "This is amazing, babe!"
# (toast with fruits/chocolate sauce, cereals with jam):
# Cam/AJ/C/T/Y/R/L: Looks like you... tried something new?
# s3_mc "I wanted to be a bit adventurous."
# Cam/AJ/C/T/Y/R/L: I can't wait to taste it.
# B/harry "Um... what's this?"
# s3_mc "It's fruit. Isn't it?"
# B/harry "But what's this on top?"
# s3_mc "Just some extra pizazz!"
# B/harry "OK... I'll give it a go."
# LI and you start to eat breakfast in comfortable silence.
# (toast with fruits/chocolate sauce, cereals with jam):
# thought "This really doesn't work..."
# thought "LI seems to be enjoying it, though."
# It's nothing fancy, but it's just nice to be together. (doesn't appear for toast with fruits/chocolate sauce, cereals with jam)
# Ciaran/Tai/Camilo/AJ/Rafi/Lily waves to someone behind you.
# C/T/Cam/AJ/R/L: Oh, hi Yasmin!
# You look around, but Yasmin isn't there.
# s3_mc "What was..."
# When you look back, you have less food than you had before.
# s3_mc "What happened there?"
# [he_she] shrugs.
# C/T/Cam/AJ/R/L: Mph goph no idfea.
# genevieve "Morning! Hope we're not intruding."
# Choiceseb "Are they intruding?"
# -Not at all
# nicky "Great, because if I don't get something to eat soon, I'm gonna eat Seb."

# -Maybe a bit
# s3_mc "But it's OK. We were just chilling."
# nicky "Great, because if I don't get something to eat soon, I'm gonna eat Seb."

# -We were just about to start going at it on the countertop
# M/iona "That doesn't sound very sanitary."
# nicky "I'm pretty glad you didn't, because if I don't get something to eat soon, I'm gonna eat Seb."

# seb "Hey! You think I'm gonna let you eat me without a fight?"
# nicky "Yeah, pretty much."
# genevieve "You'd just put on a vinyl about being eaten and sigh about it."
# seb "..."
# seb "I hate having friends who know me so well."
# elladine "What's the weirdest thing you've ever eaten because you were just that hungry?"
# AJ/C/T/yasmin "I once ate four blueberry yoghurts because they were all I had. Does that count?"
# elladine "Hmm, I guess so."
# B/H/Cam/R/L: Nothing too strange, probably just, like, old pizza or something. 
# elladine "Wow, you need to get out more!"
# (if you made toast with fruit/chocolate sauce, cereals with jam):
# Liona "This."
# s3_mc "Hey!"
# Liona "It was weird. But it ended up being pretty good in the end."
# elladine "My weirdest thing is pasta and yeast extract."
# s3_mc "Does it work?"
# elladine "Yeah. It's surprisingly good."
# seb "Mine is probably dry couscous."
# nicky "That can't have been nice, mate."
# seb "No, it was a big mistake."
# s3_mc "I can do weirder than that!"
# Choiceseb "The weirdest thing I ever ate from sheer hunger was..."
# -Raw jelly cubes
# nicky "Y'know, I think that actually sounds nice."
# genevieve "Yeah, I'm with Nicky there. I'd eat a raw jelly cube right now."
# elladine "I still think Seb's was the weirdest."

# -Mustard
# nicky "Just...mustard?"
# s3_mc "Right from the squeezy bottle."
# seb "Mustard's tasty. I get it."
# elladine "That's definitely the weirdest. I think we have a winner!"

# -Tea leaves
# nicky "Just dried tea leaves?"
# s3_mc "Yep. I ripped open a tea bag to get them."
# elladine "How hungry were you?"
# s3_mc "Very."
# elladine "Well, that's definitely the weirdest. I think we have a winner!"

# LI leans over and whispers in your ear.
# Liona "Hey MC, I think I'm gonna go lie down on the daybeds. Get some R&R, you know?"
# Liona "Do you wanna join me? Would be nice to just chill with you for a bit, especially after last night."
# Choiceseb "It would be nice to slip away for a while..."
# -Leave with LI (gem choice)
# -Stay and chat
# thought "But I was just here with LI before everyone else came in."
# Choiceseb "We haven't had much time to ourselves yet..."
# -Leave with LI (gem choice)
# -Stay and chat
# Liona "Well, I'm going to go have a nap. See you guys around."
# LI heads off towards the daybeds.

# Gem choicelladine " (Lily's missing)"
# Liona "MC and I just have to go to the daybeds to, er... do that thing. You remember the thing, right, MC?"
# s3_mc "Yes, the thing! Absolutely."
# elladine "Make out?"
# s3_mc "...Maybe."
# Liona "Bye guys!"
# You and LI head off to the daybeds, hand in hand.

# LI flops down and looks at you. [he_she] takes your hand and lazily pulls you down onto the bed.
# You fall on top of [him_her] as you both giggle softly.
# Liona "Thanks for the breakfast, by the way. I loved it."
# Choiceseb "LI enjoyed [his_her] breakfast..."
# -Don't get used to it
# s3_mc "It was a one-off. Just because you looked extra cute this morning."
# Liona "I guess I can't complain about that. (you get 😍 with LI)"

# -Anytime
# s3_mc "For you, I'd do it every day if you wanted me to."
# Liona "Careful, I might take you up on that. (you get 😍 with LI)"

# -What do I get in return?
# s3_mc "I don't just make breakfast for free, you know."
# Liona "I'm sure we'll think of something... (you get 😏 with LI)"

# As you lie on LI, you feel [his_her] chest rising with every breath.
# [he_she] strokes your head with a tender thumb. You feel the sun warming your back.
# Your troubles from the night before seem a world away.
# bill "There's a feeling you get when you're up on a roof, doing something dangerous."
# s3_mc "Huh?"
# bill "Bear with me."
# bill "If you fell, it'd be curtains for you."
# bill "But you're so sure of your crew that you don't feel afraid. You know that they've got your back."
# bill "It's a good feeling."
# bill "Anyway, that's how I feel being here with you."
# harry "You know, I used to think the key to success was getting up really early."
# harry "I don't have a plan for what to do with the extra time in the morning. You know, after I've done my affirmations."
# harry "Now, I know exactly what I'd use that time for."
# harry "I just want more time with you."
# camilo "Sometimes, when I'm just hanging around the Villa, I think about my life outside, but with you in it."
# camilo "You and me going to Spoonface's gym... Eating at Qué Más... Going down Raphael Park to feed the ducks..."
# camilo "I guess I didn't really have a point to make. I just like thinking about it, that's all."
# She smiles at you.
# s3_mc "You know, I think you're getting more freckles."
# AJ. Oh no! Too much sun...
# s3_mc "What do you mean, 'oh no'? They're adorable."
# aj "You really think so? I'm so glad."
# You stay like this for a couple of minutes, bodies rising and falling gently.
# You trace the lines of his tattoos with your finger.
# tai "That feels nice."
# s3_mc "I love your tattoos. I could get lost in them if we were here long enough."
# tai "I wouldn't stop you."
# ciaran "I had a dream the other night that you met Kerry."
# s3_mc "Big moment! How did it go?"
# ciaran "It wasn't a proper dream with a story, like."
# ciaran "Just a moment. You, me, and her, on the sofa asleep."
# ciaran "It was lovely."
# She sighs.
# yasmin "Do you ever feel like your breathing is in time with the universe?"
# s3_mc "Um, maybe."
# yasmin "That's the feeling I get when I'm with you."
# He smiles at you.
# R: When I'm lying next to you, the sun seems dimmer by comparison.
# s3_mc "What a line!"
# R: You're the kind of girl that could make a man a poet.
# Time passes you by.
# After a while, you glance at LI. [his_her] eyes are shut, and [his_her] breathing has slowed.
# You hear a few laughs from the kitchen, but otherwise, everything is peaceful.
# Choiceseb "Nobody's watching..."
# -Kiss [him_her] on the lips
# You lean forwards and plant a soft kiss on [his_her] lips.

# -Let [him_her] rest
# You nuzzle against LI, squeezing [him_her] tight.

# -Kiss [his_her] belly
# You lean forward and plant a soft kiss on [his_her] navel.

# [his_her] eyes flutter open.
# Liona "Hey."
# Liona "Was I drifting off there?"
# s3_mc "You tell me."
# Liona "I guess I might have been."
# Liona "Are we still alone?"
# s3_mc "Yeah. Everyone's hanging out in the kitchen."
# s3_mc "We've got the beds for ourselves. Not to mention this gorgeous view."
# Liona "Are we talking about the countryside, or this beautiful girl in front of me?"
# You both laugh.
# s3_mc "LI, that's so corny."
# Liona "I'm just telling it as I see it."
# You see a mischievous smile start to spread across [his_her] lips.
# Liona "Speaking of having things to ourselves..."
# Choiceseb "LI is definitely coming on to me..."
# -Cuddle [him_her]
# You collapse on top of [him_her] and squeeze tightly. You both fall into the sheets as you push [him_her] over.
# [he_she] puts [his_her] arms around you and holds you close. You can feel [his_her] chest moving as [he_she] giggles softly.

# -Start a pillow fight!
# You suddenly seize a pillow and leap on [him_her].
# s3_mc "Pillow fight!"
# Liona "Huh?"
# Before [he_she] can react, you thwack [him_her] softly with one of the pillows.
# Liona "Oh, it's on!"
# [he_she] grabs a pillow and sits up suddenly.
# Liona "Let's go!"
# Choiceseb "What's my battle plan?"
# -Hard and fast
# You whump LI with the pillow.
# [he_she] grabs it and tugs, pulling you down on top of [him_her].

# -Slow and steady
# You lightly whump LI with the pillow, but before [he_she] can react, you do it again. And again. And again.
# One the last one, LI pulls the pillow away and you fall on top of [him_her].

# -Give up already
# s3_mc "Agh! Mercy!"
# LI stops and lies back. [he_she] grins at you.
# s3_mc "I give up."
# Liona "But... you started it!"
# s3_mc "I know..."
# s3_mc "You just looked so sweet and vulnerable..."
# Liona "As long as you acknowledge me as the one true pillow king/queen."
# s3_mc "I do! I do!"
# [he_she] lowers the pillow, looking content.

# -Kiss [him_her]
# You lean in and touch LI's cheek lightly. The sun gleams on [his_her] skin.
# [he_she] leans up, lips slightly parted. Your mouths meet and [he_she] puts [his_her] arms around you.
# [his_her] hands clutch your back as you kiss. When you finally pull away, you're both flushed and breathless.

# thought "We could probably take this further..."
# thought "Everyone is still in the kitchen, after all..."
# Choiceseb "Do I want to take things further with LI?"
# -Chill out
# s3_mc "I'm so happy that I'm here."
# s3_mc "With you..."
# Liona "You took the words right out of my mouth."
# You lean into [him_her] once more, resting your head on [his_her] shoulders. [his_her] fingers entwine with yours.
# s3_mc "Can we stay out here forever?"
# Liona "Sure, babe. Let's do that."

# -Do bits
# s3_mc "Are you thinking what I'm thinking?"
# Liona "I think so."
# Liona "Why don't you show me? So we can be sure.."
# You lean forwards and kiss LI again, tracing your fingers down [his_her] neck and collarbone.
# You lightly brush [his_her] chest, letting your fingernails raise goosebumps on [his_her] exposed skin.
# [his_her] hands grip your arms and before you know it, he's/she's flipped you onto your back on the daybed.
# [he_she] holds your wrists above your head and rains kisses on your lips, your cheeks and your neck.
# [his_her] lips continue down your body, over the curve of your hips.
# [he_she] tugs your pyjamas aside and leans in closer, pressing [his_her] body against yours.
# [he_she] kisses you deeply on the mouth.
# LI shuffles a bit and pulls out a condom from behind him.
# s3_mc "Where've you been hiding that all this time?"
# B/H/Cam/C/T/R: It was tucked into my waistband.
# B/H/Cam/C/T/R: I grabbed it before we came over here.
# B/H/Cam/C/T/R: Always be prepared, that's what I say.
# s3_mc "Oh! One sec."
# You pull a condom out of your pyjamas. It's one of the ones you took on your first day.
# B/H/Cam/C/T/R: Do you just have an infinite supply in there? (you get 😂 with Bill/Harry/Camilo/Tai/Ciaran/Rafi)
# s3_mc "Always be prepared."
# You take one last glance over in the direction of the Villa.
# s3_mc "Coast is clear."
# Liona "That's what I like to hear."
# s3_mc "You're a poet, babe."
# Liona "Oh, I'm more than that..."
# Giggling, you pull the sheets over the two of you as you start to explore each other's bodies.
# [his_her] energy is electrifying. The two of you are tousling, writhing, turning... for what seems like a very long time.
# When you're finished, you roll on top of [his_her], panting heavily.
# s3_mc "I could do that all day."
# Liona "I wouldn't stop you."
# s3_mc "Someone would come out and find us, eventually."
# Liona "Yeah, well..."
# Liona "Maybe when we're out of here, eh?"
# s3_mc "Careful, I'll hold you to that."

# You stay together for a long time.
# The sun climbs higher in the sky, but you don't pay it any attention.
# For just a little while, everything is quiet. The world around you ceases to exist.
# s3_mc "Did we fall asleep?"
# Liona "We were a bit tuckered out... (you get 😏 with LI) (if you did bits)"
# You stretch.
# s3_mc "Let's go rejoin the others."
# When you head back to the kitchen, everyone is still hanging out together.
# There are empty plates and bowls lying around. No one seems to be worried about cleaning them up at the moment.

# N (L+N) / E (R+E): I can't believe it's all coming to an end.
# N (L+N) / E (R+E): We haven't even known each other that long, but I feel like I've known you for years.
# seb "It's like, you guys are a part of my life now."
# E(L+N) / N(R+E): Yeah... Hard to imagine not being here...
# genevieve "Let's stay in touch, yeah?"
# Choiceseb "Do I want to stay in touch with my friends here?"

# -Yeah, BFF's for life!
# seb "I've never been anyone's BFF before."
# E(L+N) / N(R+E): You must have mates back home?
# seb "But I've never used the phrase BFF. And neither have any of them."
# seb "They'd be more likely to call me a miserable sod. But in, like, a good way."
# E(L+N) / N(R+E): I know exactly what you mean.

# -Some people, at least
# genevieve "Though there are more people I get along with here than I thought there'd be."
# seb "Definitely."
# N (L+N) / E (R+E): I was surprised, too.
# N (L+N) / E (R+E): I had a couple of close mates back home but in general I find it pretty hard to connect meaningfully with a lot of people.
# N (L+N) / E (R+E): You lot are great, though.
# E(L+N) / N(R+E): Yeah.

# N (L+N) / E (R+E): Here's a question. Do you guys think being in the Villa changed you?
# Choiceseb "Do I think being in here has changed me?"
# -Yes, for the worst
# -Yes, for the better
# s3_mc "It's really opened me up. I've come out of my shell so much."
# seb "You didn't exactly seem in your shell at the start, kidda."
# s3_mc "You'd be surprised. A lot of it was an act."
# N (L+N) / E (R+E): Is there a difference between acting confident and being confident?
# E(L+N) / N(R+E): I think they're closer than a lot of people realise.

# -Not really
# s3_mc "I'm just me, you know?"
# s3_mc "It'll take more than a luxury holiday to fundamentally change me as a person."
# nicky "That's pretty cool. To have that much self-confidence."
# seb "I've changed for sure."
# seb "I've opened up so much."
# E(L+N) / N(R+E): Yeah, you have.

# "This show has definitely changed me."
# "I used to think finding love was so difficult."
# "Now, it seems easy."
# "All you need is to be unbelievably attractive and get picked from among thousands of hopefuls to be on TV."

# You're getting ready while BFF sits at one of the tables. She's/He's already dressed.
# (if you didn't choose the gem choice to hang out with LI on the daybeds):
# bff "That conversation earlier gave me a lot of feelings."
# (if you chose the gem choice to hang out with LI on the daybeds):
# bff "Did you and LI have fun?"
# Choiceseb "Did I have fun with LI on the daybed?"
# -I'd rather have hung out with you
# -It was nice to get some alone time
# bff "I can imagine. There won't be many chances for that now, I guess."
# s3_mc "Yeah..."

# -It was nice to get some 'alone time', wink wink
# bff "You go, girl."
# bff "Gotta take your chances where you can now, I suppose."
# s3_mc "Yeah..."

# There's a moment of silence.
# (Nicky is BFF and Lily picked him; doesn't happen with Elladine as BFF and Rafi picked her):
# Choiceseb "He seems a bit distant..."
# -Nudge him
# -Boop his nose
# You boop him on the nose.
# nicky "Huh?"
# s3_mc "I needed to get your attention somehow!"
# -Ask if he's OK
# s3_mc "Hey, Nicky. You OK?"
# nicky "Oh. Yeah."

# s3_mc "You thinking about Elladine?"
# nicky "How did you know? Was it my sour face, or my stony silence?"
# s3_mc "A bit of both."
# nicky "Well, you're a perceptive one."
# s3_mc "Do you want to talk about it?"
# nicky "It's just..."
# nicky "I really liked her."
# Choiceseb "Nicky really liked Elladine..."
# -Try to cheer him up
# s3_mc "At least you've still got me! Your good old pal!"
# nicky "Er, thanks."

# -Console him
# s3_mc "I'm sorry, Nicky. This really sucks."
# nicky "Yeah, it does."

# nicky "No matter how hard I try to keep away from drama, it always finds me."
# nicky "I don't know what to do, MC."
# nicky "I like Elladine so much. But Lily..."
# He puts his head in his hands.
# Choiceseb "Nicky is really upset..."
# -It's up to fate

# -You have to act
# s3_mc "You have to do something. Or you're just waiting around for others to do it for you."

# -It'll be OK
# s3_mc "Try not to worry, Nicky. I'm sure everything will work out."
# s3_mc "If you and Elladine are meant to be, you'll be."
# s3_mc "If not, you're better off knowing now."
# nicky "I don't want it to be out of my hands, though."

# nicky "Thanks, MC. You give good advice."
# nicky "I need to make up my mind, that much is clear."
# He takes a deep breath.
# nicky "It's OK. I'm gonna be OK."

# bff "Can I ask you a question, MC?"
# s3_mc "Sure."
# bff "Do you think we'd have been mates if we'd met out there in the real world?"
# Choiceseb "Would BFF and I have been friends on the outside?"
# -I'm not really sure
# s3_mc "It's hard to say."
# s3_mc "But we're friends now, and that's all that matters."

# -Maybe not as intensely
# bff "You think?"
# s3_mc "The Villa has this weird way of, like, intensifying relationships."
# s3_mc "I'd never have felt this close to someone after 11 days, you know?"
# bff "hmm, I see your point."
# bff "I feel like I've known you forever."

# -Definitely 
# bff "I think so too."
# bff "You're great."
# s3_mc "You too."

# BFF smiles at you.
# s3_mc "Right, time to get dressed and face the day."
# Outfit change to swimwear
# thought "Old reliable. Hasn't failed me yet!"
# bff "I love that on you."
# thought "This'll have to do..."
# bff "I'm pretty sure you'd look in a potato sack, MC."
# BFF gets up and stretches.
# bff "Right, I'm going to work out a bit, I think."
# s3_mc "Sure thing."
# BFF gets up and heads downstairs.
# bff "Oh, hi, LI."
# LI comes up the stairs.
# Liona "Hi, babe. I thought I'd come see how you were feeling."
# Liona "You know about us. Now we're near the end."
# Choiceseb "How am I feeling?"
# -I'm sad it's going to end
# Liona "Yeah..."
# Liona "We really didn't have that long to get to know each other, when you think about it."
# Liona "I feel like we've known each other for ages, though."
# Liona "You're really important to me, MC."

# -I'm hungry
# Liona "We just had breakfast!"
# s3_mc "Something must have made me hungry."
# s3_mc "Can't quite think what it could have been, though..."
# Liona "Oh, right. Yeah."
# Liona "That was amazing."

# -I feel positive about us
# s3_mc "I mean, I feel like that was a given, considering what we did earlier."
# Liona "That's really good to hear. (you get 😍 with LI)"
# (MC sticking with her partner):
# Liona "My head was never really turned, but I was so worried yours would be."
# Liona "I trust you, but Rafi/Lily was pretty intimidating..."
# s3_mc "Not a patch on you, boo."
# Liona "Thanks."
# (MC recoupling with Rafi/Lily):
# R/L: I know it's all been a bit of a whirlwind, but I think we're in a good place.
# R/L: It's hard to say what'll happen with the final and everything.
# R/L: We haven't been together that long...
# R/L: But it doesn't matter.
# s3_mc "No, it doesn't. All that matters is the time we have."

# Just then your phone pings.
# text "Islanders! Building a relationship takes planning and compromise, and only strong foundations lead to winners. Gather outside on the lawn to see if you've got what it takes! #beachykeen #sandland"
# Liona "What do you think that means?"
# s3_mc "No idea, let's get the others and find out!"

# "That was cryptic! Definitely something to do with building, but if you're expecting a construction joke out of me.."
# "...you'll have to come back later. I'm still working on it."
# "Oldie but goldie!"
# "Speaking of which, seeing MC and BFF makes me miss my old best friend."
# "His name was Ayrshire. We did everything together."
# "It had all come to an end eventually, though."
# "Potatoes really don't last that long. He went all wrinkly and my mum threw him out."
# "Next time on Love Island..."
# "We find out that Seb probably needs a trip to the optician."
# seb "Hm. I never noticed that huge pile of sand before."
# "And LI gets hit with a super-ray."

# "Welcome back to Love Island!"
# "This morning MC got cheeky with LI..."
# s3_mc "We've got the beds to ourselves. Not to mention this gorgeous view."
# Liona "Are we talking about the countryside, or this beautiful girl in front of me?"
# "And things got a bit emosh..."
# genevieve "Let's stay in touch, yeah?"
# "Finally, LI got a text about today's challenge! It's bound to be a good one..."
# "Tell me, what's coarse, rough, and irritating all at once?"
# "No, it's not Seb."
# "What? Of course it's not me!"
# "Oh, you'll see."

# You and other Islanders walk out onto the lawn.
# In the middle of the lawn, there is a huge sandpile.
# seb "Hm. I never noticed that huge pile of sand before."
# genevieve "Your powers of observation are clearly lacking."
# (only appears if Miki isn't dumped):
# miki "No, guys, don't you see? It must be for the challenge."
# B(coupled with Miki) : Yeah, hun, we know.
# B (coupled with MC): Yeah, we know.
# miki "Oh. Well, good."
# LI's phones ping.
# text "Islanders! It's time for today's challenge. In your couples, use the sand to create your dream home. The couple with the most popular house will win a special date for tonight! #restingbeachface #vitaminsea"
# (Only appears if Tai didn't leave):
# tai "Oh, I'm gonna smash this."
# tai "I always built sandcastles when I was a kid, before we moved to England. (MC not coupled with Tai)"
# tai "We're totally gonna win that date! I can already taste the champagne."
# (MC coupled with AJ/Yasmin/Lily):
# He turns to Ciaran with a grin.
# tai "I can already taste the champagne."
# ciaran "Let's win this thing."
# (MC not coupled with AJ/Yasmin/Lily):
# LI turns to you with a smile.
# Liona "This is gonna be so fun! Come on, let's get started."
# You and LI run over to the sandpit before anyone else, bagging a great spot right in the middle.
# s3_mc "Aw, yes! We got the most sand!"
# (MC coupled with AJ or recoupled with Lily and AJ left):
# harry "Volume of sand won't help you, babe. I've had my dream house planned out since I was three."
# genevieve "What does it look like?"
# harry "No spoilers! Wait and see."
# (MC not coupled with AJ and AJ didn't leave):
# aj "MC, it's not the amount of sand. It's the skill. And I've got pure skills."
# s3_mc "You do?"
# aj "Yeah! Sick dexterity, dude."
# She flexes her fingers at you and winks.
# Choiceseb "The others seem confident..."
# -Rise above it
# s3_mc "I'm not going to dignify that with a response."
# s3_mc "Come on, LI, they're only trying to mess with us."

# -Just start building
# s3_mc "Let's get a head start, LI."

# -Trash talk
# s3_mc "I hope you lot are better builders than you are cowboys."
# s3_mc "Otherwise this is going to be a very easy challenge. (not picking the gem choice during the bull ride challenge)"
# s3_mc "Or I'll end up being the sheriff and the queen of the sandcastles.(picking the gem choice during the bull ride challenge)"

# L(L+N) / R(R+E): Oh, you're on, MC.
# Liona "Come on, babe! Let's get building."

# You start moulding sand into a pile. LI helps you.
# Liona "By the way babe, I forgot to say..."
# Liona "You look amazing today. Again. (you get 🤩 with LI)"
# s3_mc "Aw, thanks, babe!"
# Soon you have a good foundation.
# Liona "OK! Time to make our first architectural decision."
# Liona "How big do you want the house to be?"
# Choiceseb "How big do I want my future house to be?"
# -Huge! (Ciaran and Lilly missing)
# B/Cam/Y/AJ/T/R: Ooh, OK!
# harry "I like your style! That's just how I want mine, too."
# Bill/Camilo/Yasmin/AJ/Harry/Tai clumps together more sand to form a huge foundation.

# -Small and cosy (Harry,Camilo,AJ,Ciaran,Yasmin,Rafi,Lily missing)
# B/tai "Aw, that's sweet!"
# bill "I'd love to cosy up with you, babe."
# bill "We'll leave it as it is, then."
# tai "Though I don't know if I'll fit..."
# tai "Eh, we'll call it cosy."

# -Big enough for a family
# B/C/camilo "That's just what I wanted! (you get 😍 with Bill/Ciaran/Camilo)"
# H/T/AJ/L/R/yasmin "Wow, you don't mess around."
# H/T/AJ/L/R/yasmin "Family size it is!"
# Harry/Tai/AJ/Lily/Rafi/Yasmin adds more sand to the foundation to form a medium-sized base.

# Liona "Right! Now for the fun stuff."
# Liona "What style of house do you want?"
# Choiceseb "What style of house do I want?"
# -A castle (Harry,Ciaran,Yasmin missing)
# B/T/Cam/AJ/R/L: Woah! Yes!
# B/T/Cam/AJ/R/L: And I have just the bucket for the job.
# Bill/Tai/Camilo/AJ/Rafi/Lily grabs one of the buckets and spade.
# [he_she] fills up the bucket with sand, tips it upside-down onto your foundation, and out pops a perfect castle.
# B/T/Cam/AJ/R/L: Get in. That looks amazing!
# s3_mc "Great job, hun!"
# B/T/Cam/AJ/R/L: Thanks!

# -Modern and sleek (AJ,Yasmin,Lily missing)
# C/T/R: Your wish is my command!
# B/camilo "Aw, really? I always pictured myself in something more homely."
# s3_mc "Homely as in 'poor thing was such a homely child'. You wanted it to be more unattractive?"
# B/camilo "No, no, I mean homely. More like a home!"
# s3_mc "Ah, ok. That makes more sense."
# B/camilo "I guess it's only a sandcastle."
# harry "Yes! I knew I liked you for a reason."
# harry "I mean, there are a million reasons."
# harry "I'm just gonna build it now."
# You help LI gather sand, but it soon becomes obvious that he's/she's got [his_her] own idea.
# You sit back and watch [him_her] craft a cube.
# You wait for there to be more, but [he_she] seems finished.
# miki "Er, hun? It's a cube."
# Liona "Modern art! Do you like it?"
# s3_mc "Sure, babe. It's great."

# -I don't mind
# s3_mc "As long as you're there with me. I don't care what it looks like."
# Liona "Aw babe! That's so cute."
# harry "Modern it is!"
# harry "Modern art! Do you like it?"
# s3_mc "What's important is that you like it, hun."
# Bill/Camilo/Rafi/Lily/Tai eyes up the bucket and spade next to you.
# B/Cam/R/L/tai "Well, shame to waste this..."
# Bill/Camilo/Rafi/Lily/Tai fills up the bucket with sand, tips it upside-down onto your foundation, and out pops a perfect castle.
# s3_mc "We're gonna live in a castle?"
# B/Cam/R/L/tai "Got a problem with that?"
# s3_mc "Not at all, Your Highness."
# B/Cam/R/L/tai "Ooh, I could get used to that."
# C/Y/aj "I'll just make us something normal."
# Ciaran/Yasmin/AJ shapes a roof, a chimney, and a door.
# C/Y/aj "Kind of looks like my house at home!"
# s3_mc "Looks great, babe. "

# (picture of “Your sand castle!”)
# Liona "Alright, it's looking pretty good I think."
# You both look around at the other Islanders' castles.
# s3_mc "I don't think we'll have much competition."
# Liona "Agreed."
# While looking around, you notice that Nicky doesn't seem into his sandcastle, Lily has done all of the building.
# While looking around, you notice that Elladine doesn't seem into her sandcastle, Rafi has done all of the building.
# Choiceseb "Nicky/Elladine seems distracted..."
# -Leave it
# thought "I'm sure he's/she's fine. Besides, this task is important."

# -Talk to [him_her]
# s3_mc "Give me a minute, LI."
# Liona "Sure, babe. I'll keep working on it."
# You walk over to the side of the sandpit, motioning for Nicky/Elladine to follow you.
# [he_she] approaches you, looking confused.
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): MC? What's up?
# s3_mc "I just wanted to see if you're OK."
# s3_mc "You don't look like yourself."
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): I'm fine...
# [he_she] starts tearing up.
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): I'm fine. I've just got sand in my eye.
# Choiceseb "Nicky/Elladine says he's/she's fine..."
# -Leave it
# s3_mc "I'll take your word for it. But I'm here for you."
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): Thanks for checking up on me, MC. You're a good friend.

# -Dig deeper
# s3_mc "You're in a difficult situation. This whole challenge must be hard, considering."
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): I just...
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): I feel guilty. I should be doing this with Elladine/Nicky.
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): But now Lily/Rafi is talking about how many bedrooms we want in our dream house...
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): It's just overwhelming.
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): I don't even know where Elladine/Nicky is right now.
# s3_mc "I'm sorry."
# nicky "That's OK."
# [he_she] wipes his eyes.
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): Sand's gone. Thanks, MC. Nice to know someone's looking out for me.
# s3_mc "Anytime."

# You and Nicky/Elladine head back to your partners.
# LI gives you a smile, but doesn't ask.

# Liona "OK, let's add something in the garden. Then we'll definitely win."
# H/AJ/R: And winning is, of course, the most important part of this challenge.
# s3_mc "Oh, of course."
# H/R: Shall we add a moat?
# H/R: You know, to keep out our enemies!
# s3_mc "What enemies do you have?!"
# H/R: None right now. But you can't succeed in life without at least one!
# H/R: If I get through life without gaining an arch-nemesis, I've failed.
# B/C/camilo "We could add a swingset or something? For kids?"
# B/C/camilo "I mean... if you want that."
# T/Y/AJ/L: We could add a nice flower garden.
# T/Y/AJ/L: For just hanging out together.
# T/Y/AJ/L: Can you imagine the Sunday afternoons?
# Choiceseb "What do I want behind my house?"
# -Flower garden
# T/aj "Yay!"
# T/aj "It's gonna look so pretty."
# Y/R/C/L: It's gonna look so cute!
# Y/R/C/L: I can totally picture us hanging out in there, babe.
# harry "Oh, OK."
# harry "That sounds nice too, I guess."
# harry "Flowers can have enemies, right?"
# B/camilo "That would be nice!"
# You help LI dig around the outside of the sandcastle.
# LI stands up and holds out [his_her] hand to you.
# s3_mc "What are you doing?"
# Liona "We need some flowers, don't we?"
# You let [him_her] pull you to your feet and lead you over to a nearby bush.
# Liona "Well, leaves will do."
# [he_she] starts pulling leaves off the bush.
# Choiceseb "LI is vandalising the Villa!"
# -Help [him_her]
# You start helping LI gather leaves.
# Liona "Hey! Thanks for helping, babe."
# s3_mc "That's OK!"
# You both make your way back to the sandcastle, where LI arranges the leaves to look like a garden.
# Liona "That looks great!"
# s3_mc "Great idea, babe."

# -Dob [him_her] in
# You shout to the other Islanders.
# s3_mc "Guys! LI's ruining this bush!"
# Miki/Iona smirks.
# M/iona "Too much information, babes."
# seb "MC, nobody cares. Stop being a tattle-tale."
# Liona "Yeah, I'm only trying to win the challenge and take you on a date!"
# Liona "Not like I've got a can of spray paint."

# -Sabotage [him_her]
# You knock the leaves out of [his_her] hand.
# [he_she] looks at you, betrayal in [his_her] eyes.
# Liona "Why?"
# s3_mc "I am an agent of chaos."
# LI grumbles as [he_she] picks the leaves back up.

# -Moat (AJ,Ciaran,Tai,Yasmin,Lily missing)
# R: Well, I'd never say no to a little extravagance...
# harry "Aw, yes!"
# harry "No way those environmentalists are getting in."
# B/camilo "Aw, yeah!"
# B/camilo "Like we're in a proper medieval castle, yeah?"
# B/camilo "Love it!"
# You help LI dig around the outside of the sandcastle.
# You make a circle a few inches deep.
# Liona "It doesn't really look like a moat..."
# s3_mc "Maybe if there was some water."
# Liona "Oh, I know!"
# [he_she] grabs [his_her] water bottle from beside [him_her] and pours the rest of the contents into the moat.
# Liona "That looks better, doesn't it?"
# s3_mc "Looks great, babe."

# -Playset (Harry,AJ,Lily,Rafi missing)
# yasmin "You're cute."
# Ciaran bursts into a huge smile.
# ciaran "Aw, MC! I'm so glad we're on the same page about this."
# (if you chose “start a business” or “go travelling” in the morning):
# ciaran "I thought, based on what you said this morning, that you don't want kids."
# ciaran "No pressure, but it's nice to know you're thinking about it."
# (if you chose “getting married and have kids” in the morning):
# ciaran "I'm so glad we talked about that this morning."
# ciaran "I feel so warm inside now."
# ciaran "The cheesy lines just pour out of me when I'm with you."
# tai "Aw, babe!"
# B/camilo "I was hoping you'd say that."
# You help LI dig around the outside of the sandcastle.
# You grab some sticks from the nearby grass and arrange them crudely to look like a swingset.
# Liona "Aw, we have to do better than that."
# Liona "If I was a kid, I'd rather jump off the thing than play on it."
# s3_mc "Harsh, but fair."
# Liona "Got any ideas?"
# Choiceseb "How can I make this swingset better? (no further reactions)"
# -Get creative
# -Improvise
# -Raid the Villa

# You leave LI and rush over to the kitchen, grabbing three forks from a drawer.
# Behind your sandcastle, you balance one fork on the other two, making a framework.
# Liona "Wow, that's loads better!"
# L: I have an idea!
# He runs to a nearby bush and grabs two leaves with long stems, before tying the stems to the top of the framework.
# The leaves blow back and forth, looking almost exactly like swings.
# You and LI beam at each other.
# s3_mc "This looks great!"
# Liona "We built it together. So cute."
# yasmin "It's a bit overwhelming, looking at that playset..."
# yasmin "Let's just take it slow, OK?"
# B/C/Cam/tai "It makes me really excited looking at this with you."
# B/C/Cam/tai "After what we talked about this morning I can't get it out of my head..."
# B/C/Cam/tai "I'm just glad we're on the same page."
# s3_mc "Me too, babe. (Bill/Ciaran/Camilo/Tai)"

# You finish up the sandcastle and look at it with LI.
# It's well-made, and right to your taste.
# (picture of “Your sand castle!”)
# (different reactions from the LI for the combinations):
# Bill/Ciaran/Camilo:
# family/huge/small+don't mind+playset:
# Bill/Camilo/Ciaran beams at you.
# B/Cam/ciaran "We nailed this challenge!"
# B/Cam/ciaran "It's so nice to know we're on the same page about a lot of this stuff."
# any other combination:
# Bill/Camilo/Ciaran gives you a smile.
# B/Cam/ciaran "Well, it's all about compromise, right?"
# B/Cam/ciaran "I'd still totally love to live here with you, babe."
# AJ/Tai/Lily:
# family/huge/small+don't mind+flower:
# AJ/Tai/Lily beams at you.
# AJ/T/L: We nailed this challenge!
# AJ/T/L: It's so nice to know we're on the same page about a lot of this stuff.
# any other combination:

# You look around the other couples' finished castles, trying to judge the competition.
# (picture of “Seb and Genevieve's moody lighthouse”)
# Seb and Genevieve's 'castle' is more like a lighthouse, with winding steps and windows poked into it.
# (picture of “Lily/Rafi (and Nicky's/Elladine's)-sandcastle”)
# Nicky/Elladine and Lily's/Rafi's castle is beautiful and grandiose.
# It's clear that it's Lily's/Rafi's creation, as Nicky/Elladine is watching her work, looking impressed.
# (picture of “Miki/Iona and Bill's/Camilo's/Harry's modern art”)
# Miki/Iona and Bill's/Harry's/Camilo's castle is minimalistic and abstract, lots of winding corridors and art features. 
# Bill looks slightly annoyed, but Miki beams, proud of it. (Bill+Miki)
# They both look very proud. (Miki/Iona+Harry)
# Camilo puts the finishing touches on it, while Iona watches, impressed. (Cam+Iona)
# (MC coupled with AJ or recoupled with Lily and AJ left):

# Tai and Ciaran's creation is a bit lumpy, with a huge door and what looks like a rugby pitch in the garden.
# (MC not coupled with AJ):
# (picture of “AJ and Tai's/Harry's(MC coupled with Tai/Yasmin)... sad castle”)
# AJ and Tai's/Harry's(MC coupled with Tai/Yasmin) sandcastle is a big lump.They pout at it, desperately trying to fix it with spades.

# The other Islanders murmur in agreement.
# Liona "I guess that settles it!"
# Li puts [his_her] hand up for a high five.
# Liona "We won, babe!"
# Choiceseb "LI wants a high five..."
# -Give it
# You raise your own hand and high five LI.
# s3_mc "Here's to winning!"
# Liona "Aw, yeah!"

# -Go for a low five instead
# You hold out your hand.
# Liona "Huh? Oh!"
# After a moment of confusion, [he_she] returns the low five.
# Liona "Best team. No question."

# -Kiss [him_her]
# You grab [his_her] outstretched hand and pull [him_her] towards you, planting your lips on [his_her] dramatically.
# [he_she] grins at you. You hear another Islander wolf-whistle.
# s3_mc "What? I thought it was worth celebrating."
# Liona "No argument here."

# [he_she] steps closer to you, but stumbles suddenly. [his_her] foot goes straight through your sandcastle.

# Liona "Although, I do feel pretty powerful now. Like Godzilla."
# Choiceseb "Li said stomping on the sandcastle was fun..."

# -Crush them all! (gem choice)
# -Nah
# s3_mc "No thanks, babe. Don't want to get sand in every extremity."
# Liona "That's fair."

# Gem choice:
# You look around at the remaining sandcastles.
# They look quiet.
# Too quiet.
# Flexing your muscles, you approach the first sandcastle...
# Choiceseb "What should I do?"
# -Jump on top of it
# You leap on top of the castle with both feet, and it collapses beneath your weight.

# -Sit on it
# You turn around and take a moment to line yourself up, before dropping on top of the castle butt-first.
# It sinks beneath your weight.

# -Kick it like a football
# You take a run-up as if you're about to take a penalty at the World Cup.
# With all your might, you then kick the tower of sand right in the middle, sending chunks flying.

# It's incredibly satisfying.
# Adrenaline surges through you, and you let out a monster-like roar.
# s3_mc "Fear me! I am the sandcastle destroyer!"
# You manage to stop on one more sandcastle before Camilo/Bill(if he was not dumped and is not coupled with MC) / Tai comes to challenge your title.
# Cam/B/tai "You dare presume you are the only challenger?!"
# He kicks over a sandcastle and beats his chest with his fists.
# Cam/B/tai "I am the true son of the Sand God!"
# Choiceseb "Camilo/Bill/Tai has come to challenge my title..."
# -Throw sand at him (jumps directly to “you take a handful of wet sand...)

# -Pretend to concede
# s3_mc "It is true that you are the true sun."
# You kneel in front of him.
# s3_mc "But that does not mean I am not the true daughter!"

# -Beat your chest and roar back
# You stand up and face him, beating your chest in response.
# s3_mc "Raagghhh!"
# Cam/B/tai "Raaaagghhh!"
# You roar back and forth a few times, before you realise you're at a stalemate.
# The other Islanders are laughing as they watch you both.
# s3_mc "You're strong, but are you fast as well?"

# You take a handful of wet sand from Viv and Seb's moat, ball it up, and lob it at Camilo/Bill/Tai.
# It hits him in the chest and he falls backwards onto his own sandcastle.
# s3_mc "You dare challenge me?!"
# Cam/B/tai "I have been defeated!"
# You continue your rampage, and soon the other Islanders join in, stomping around in the sand and destroying everything they've built.
# (MC coupled with AJ/Yasmin/Lily):
# You see Tai and Ciaran start to lark around in the sand. Both seem to be having the time of their lives.
# Sand is being hurled past you from every direction.
# LI takes your hand in the chaos.
# Liona "Alliance?"
# Choiceseb "Do I want to form an alliance with LI?"
# -No way! Every Islander for themselves
# -I'm a lover not a fighter

# Liona "Good idea. Looks like it's about to go wild."
# [he_she] leads you to the fringe of the fight.

# s3_mc "Guess I'm waiting then."

# You sit on the loungers by the pool with the other Islanders.
# The sun beats down on your skin, warming you from head to toe. You close your eyes.
# You are content, until...
# T/AJ(MC coupled with Tai or left Tai for Rafi): Cannonball!
# You open your eyes to see Tai/AJ jumping into the pool, tucking [his_her] knees up into [his_her] chest.
# s3_mc "Tai/AJ(MC coupled with Tai or left Tai for Rafi)!"
# T/AJ(MC coupled with Tai or left Tai for Rafi): What?
# [he_she] grins at you from the pool.
# T/AJ(MC coupled with Tai or left Tai for Rafi): I'm not waiting all day for the shower when there's a perfectly good pool here. Sand is itchy!
# Liona "That's a point. The shower's taking ages."

# seb "I like being clean as much as the next guy, but come on."
# s3_mc "Who's in there?"
# seb "I wasn't about to put my nose up to the door, was I?"
# T/AJ(MC coupled with Tai or left Tai for Rafi): Is no-one going to get in the pool with me?
# Choiceseb "Do I want to jump in the pool?"
# -No way
# -Only if everyone does
# seb "I mean, is it really the right time? I just want to have a shower."
# B/camilo "Come on, Seb, mate. Let's just wash off in the pool, it'll be fun."
# seb "Fine!"
# The other Islanders start to jump into the pool one by one.
# You follow soon after.

# -Yes!
# You give LI a wink before jumping into the pool.
# The cool water envelops you. You hear a cheer from Tai.
# When you surface, you see all the other Islanders jumping in after you.
# T/AJ(MC coupled with Tai or left Tai for Rafi): That's more like it!

# LI swims up to you and wraps [his_her] arms around you.
# Choiceseb "What shall I do with LI in the pool?"
# -Dunk [him_her]
# You let LI get close to you, before dunking [his_her] head quickly underwater.
# [he_she] glares at you.
# Liona "Oh, I'm gonna get you."
# [he_she] starts swimming after you. You try to swim away, but [he_she] catches you easily. But instead of getting revenge, [he_she] just kisses you.
# s3_mc "Aw, babe!"
# s3_mc "So cute."

# -Ride on [his_her] shoulders
# s3_mc "Can I ride on your shoulders?"
# Liona "Sure!"
# You stand in the pool with your legs apart. LI swims through them until [his_her] head is between them.
# [he_she] stands, and you're lifted up onto [his_her] shoulders.
# s3_mc "This is awesome! I feel like I'm eleven feet tall!"
# Liona "You kind of are."
# Liona "Oh, no, I'm gonna drop you..."
# LI tips you off [his_her] shoulders. You splash down into the pool.
# s3_mc "Hey, that was on purpose!"
# Liona "Impossible to say..."

# -Kiss [him_her] underwater
# s3_mc "Underwater kiss?"
# Liona "Underwater kiss."
# You press your lips to LI's, letting yourselves sink under the water.
# All sounds and feelings melt away, all except the feeling of LI's lips on yours, [his_her] hands on your body.
# When you come up for air, you grin at each other.
# Liona "You're such a romantic."
# s3_mc "What can I say?"
# s3_mc "Nothing wrong with getting wet once in a while."

# Eventually, you and the other Islanders make your way out of the pool.
# You see Elladine(L+N)/Nicky(R+E) appear from the Villa. She starts walking towards the pool, a hesitant smile on her face.
# E(L+N) / N(R+E): Hi, guys.
# Liona "Elladine! That's where you've been."
# Choiceseb "Elladine/Nicky has been inside the Villa all afternoon!"
# -I didn't notice [he_she] was gone...
# -I was wondering where [he_she] was!
# thought "The challenge felt weird without her/him around..."

# -I don't blame her/him
# thought "I can't imagine [he_she] wants to do much socialising after last night."

# E(L+N) / N(R+E): Sorry for bailing on the challenge.
# E(L+N) / N(R+E): I didn't feel like building a couple's sandcastle on my own.
# E(L+N) : Kind of a lonely way to spend an afternoon.
# N(R+E): It would have just ended up being filled with cats.
# seb "Hey, that doesn't sound so bad."
# harry "Are you who's been hogging the shower? (MC not coupled with Harry)"
# tai "So you were in the shower!"
# Nicky(coupled with Lily)/Elladine(coupled with Rafi) nudges him.
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): Let her/him talk.
# E(L+N) / N(R+E): Yeah, I was in the shower for ages. It's a good place to think things through.
# E(L+N) / N(R+E): Plus, it covered up the sound of you lot having a great time out here.
# E(L+N) / N(R+E): MC, I definitely heard you roar a few times.
# Choiceseb "Elladine/Nicky heard my monster noises from inside the Villa..."
# -Deny it
# s3_mc "That was LI."
# s3_mc "That's just how I make [him_her] feel, I guess..."
# Liona "Ha, you wish."

# -Own up to it
# s3_mc "Yeah, that was me."
# s3_mc "And I'd do it again!"
# E(L+N) / N(R+E): Ha, knew it.

# -Roar again
# s3_mc "Oh, you mean like this?"
# You let out another roar.
# s3_mc "Raaaaagghhh!"
# E(L+N) / N(R+E): Ha, knew it.

# N(L+N) / E(R+E): Why are you all dressed up?

# yasmin "Elladine/Nicky, what aren't you saying? (MC coupled with AJ or AJ left)"
# Elladine/Nicky takes a deep breath.
# E(L+N) / N(R+E): I'm leaving.
# A gasp comes from the Islanders around you.
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): What the hell?
# Choiceseb "Elladine/Nicky is leaving the Villa..."
# -I'm shocked!
# thought "I never saw it coming!"
# thought "It must be because of last night's recoupling..."

# -I'll miss her/him so much
# thought "She's/He's one of the coolest people in here."

# -I'm not surprised
# thought "After losing Nicky/Elladine like that, I saw it coming."

# genevieve "Elladine/Nicky, you don't have to leave!"
# E(L+N) / N(R+E): Guys, I've thought about this long and hard.
# E(L+N) / N(R+E): It's not easy, trust me. I've made some amazing friends in here.
# (Elladine/Nicky as BFF and that person is leaving):
# E(L+N) / N(R+E): That's part of why I've made this decision. MC and I had a chat this morning, and she helped me see what I had to do.
# Elladine/Nicky smiles at you.
# E(L+N) / N(R+E): Thing is, there won't be any new people. It's the end of the line for me, whatever happens.
# E(L+N) / N(R+E): And I don't feel up to hanging around, waiting to get dumped.
# E(L+N) / N(R+E): So I'm leaving on my own terms. Just like Rafi/Lily/MC's former partner.
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): Babe...
# Nicky/Elladine starts to cry, tears rolling down [his_her] cheeks.
# Lily/Rafi pats Nicky/Elladine on the back.
# E(L+N) / N(R+E): It was fun while it lasted, but without Nicky, there's nothing here for me anymore.
# E(L+N) / N(R+E): I'll miss you guys.
# The Islanders swarm around her, giving her hugs.
# Choiceseb "Shall I hug Elladine/Nicky?"
# -No, stay out of it
# -Yes, join in
# You hurry forward and join the group hug surrounding Elladine/Nicky.
# Seb desperately tries to get closer to Elladine/Nicky, his face squishing against your arm in the chaos.
# (Elladine leaving):
# Elladine seems surprised by Seb's eagerness, and laughs as she hugs him back.
# (Nicky leaving):
# seb "Mate, we'll hook up on the podcast, yeah?"
# nicky "Yeah, man. You know it."
# Eventually, everyone breaks apart.

# -Hug her/him separately
# You wait for everyone to finish before you head in to hug Elladine/Nicky.
# [he_she] returns it, a sad look in her/his eyes.
# E(L+N) / N(R+E): It was really nice getting to know you, MC. I'm sure we'll see each other again soon.
# Eventually, you break apart.

# E(L+N) / N(R+E): Well, I'm all packed.
# E(L+N) / N(R+E): No time like the present, eh?

# You and the other Islanders stand crowded around the entrance, waiting for Elladine/Nicky to grab her/his suitcase.
# Nicky/Elladine stands closest to the door, staring out to the world beyond.
# C(not dumped): I can't believe she's/he's leaving. It's wild.
# T(if Ciaran was dumped): I can't believe she's/he's leaving. It doesn't feel right!

# yasmin "You shouldn't be sad. This is happening for a reason."

# E(L+N) / N(R+E): Thanks, MC. That's really nice of you to say.

# E(L+N) / N(R+E): Thanks for helping me make this decision. I couldn't have done all this without you.

# Elladine/Nicky gets a final hug from everyone else, before meeting Nicky/Elladine at the door.
# They hug, Nicky/Elladine squeezing extra hard.
# Then they whisper a few things to each other that you can't make out, before separating.

# Liona "We won, babe!"
# "MC and LI are going on a very special date!"
# thought "This is my last Love Island date before the final."
# thought "I need to look my absolute best tonight!"
# Outfit change to evening wear
# You're putting the finishing touches to your outfit when LI appears in the doorway.
# s3_mc "Hey, babe. What do you think?"
# Liona "I love that one."
# Liona "You always look so good in it, and I'm sure you don't need me to tell you."
# For a moment, [he_she] just stares at you, speechless.
# Liona "MC... you look incredible."
# s3_mc "I'm glad you like it."
# Liona "You always look beautiful, no matter what you're wearing."
# [he_she] notices you struggling with a zip on the back of your outfit.
# B/H/R/L: Here, let me help.
# C/T/Cam/Y/aj "Can I help?"
# Choiceseb "LI's offering to zip me up..."
# -I can do it!
# -Thanks, babe
# You turn around and hold your hair out of the way.
# [he_she] tugs the zip into place, then turns you back around to admire you again.
# Liona "Perfect."

# -I wish you were unzipping me instead...
# Liona "So do I, believe me..."
# You turn around and hold your hair out of the way.
# [he_she] tugs the zip into place, then turns you back around to admire you again.
# Liona "Perfect."

# Liona "All ready now?"
# s3_mc "All ready."
# s3_mc "I've got a text!"
# Liona "What does it say?"
# text "MC and LI, it's time for your final date. And because you won the dream home challenge, you have an extra special evening ahead of you. Your final Love Island date will be taking place in a hot air balloon. #basketbaes #milehighclub"
# Liona "Woah!"
# Choiceseb "We're going on a date in a hot air balloon!"
# -Been there, done that
# Liona "Wow, have you really had a date in a hot air balloon?"
# s3_mc "Yeah, of course."
# Liona "Well, you've never done that with me before, so this'll still be a first."

# -But I'm scared of heights!
# Liona "Don't worry, babe, you'll be fine!"
# Liona "And you can hang on to me the whole time if it makes you feel better."
# s3_mc "Alright. Thanks, LI."

# -That's so romantic
# s3_mc "Floating above the whole world with you... I can't wait."
# Liona "Me neither!"

# Liona "Let's go!"

# You and LI stand together in the basket of your hot air balloon.
# It sways gently as it rises above the rolling green hills. The evening air is warm on your skin.
# Liona "This is amazing."
# bill "I thought I was over heights by now, y'know, being on roofs all day."
# bill "But I've never done anything like that before."
# harry "This is the kind of thing I wanna be doing with my life, y'know?"
# harry "Someday I wanna work in an office and ride a hot air balloon there every morning."
# harry "Or have an office in a hot air balloon!"
# harry "No, no, that wouldn't work. Nowhere to plug in the printer."
# camilo "It's a long way from selling newspapers in Romford, I'll tell you that much."
# aj "I know we're not supposed to try and rock the basket, but I'm so excited, I'm having a hard time keeping still!"
# tai "I mean, I'm used to being the tallest person in the room... but this is a step beyond."
# tai "If my ma could see me now..."
# ciaran "Oh, wait. I guess she can."
# ciaran "I'm gonna try not to think about that too much."
# yasmin "The air... the clouds..."
# yasmin "I feel like we're so in harmony with the universe right now."
# R: I did a fashion shoot in a balloon basket once, but it didn't actually leave the ground.
# R: It was just against a green screen, and then they edited the sky in afterwards. Which doesn't really count.
# L: Logically, I know I'll be fine, but still...
# L: I like to imagine we're doing something a bit risky by being up here.
# Liona "How are you finding it, now that we're up here?"
# Choiceseb "How am I finding this date?"
# -It feels like we're going on an adventure
# s3_mc "You know? Setting off into the unknown, floating wherever the wind takes us."
# Liona "Yeah! Who knows what's over that horizon?"
# s3_mc "Could be anything! Even sky pirates!"
# Liona "Oh no! Not sky pirates!"

# -The view is so beautiful and romantic
# s3_mc "It's stunning."
# Liona "Just like you."
# Liona "Sorry, That was cheesy."

# -I feel a bit nervous, being so high up
# s3_mc "I know we're safe, but my legs feel all wobbly."
# Liona "Aw, hun. Come here."
# LI wraps an arm around your waist to steady you. Straight away, you start feeling more comfortable.
# s3_mc "Thanks, babe."

# Liona "You know, we should elect a captain. Just in case we do end up floating away and have to start a new life up here."
# B/H/Cam/Y/R/L: I don't know about you, but I feel like I've got the natural leadership qualities to head up an expedition like this.
# C/T/aj "To be honest, I think I'd be more comfortable knowing you were in command."
# Choiceseb "Who should be captain of our hot air balloon?"
# -I should be the one in charge
# s3_mc "I've got grit and determination and a level head. I'm the obvious choice."
# s3_mc "Raise the sails! Splice the mainbrace! Dolly in the forecastle!"
# Liona "Aye aye then, captain."

# -I'd rather leave that to you
# s3_mc "I'm not really the captaining type."
# s3_mc "Besides, I think you'd look cute in a captain's hat."
# Liona "What's a captain's hat look like?"
# s3_mc "You know... one of those big triangular ones?"
# s3_mc "I just think you'd look cute in a hat."
# Liona "Thanks, babe."
# Liona "I'll be your captain, no problem."

# -Why can't we both be co-captains?
# s3_mc "You know? We should make decisions together."
# Liona "But what if I want to go east and you want to go west?"
# s3_mc "Then we figure it out, don't we? Just like in a relationship."

# s3_mc "That said, I have no idea how to steer a hot air balloon."
# s3_mc "So either way, we're just gonna have to go wherever the wind blows us."
# B/H/Cam/T/C/R/aj "It's still a nice thought, though, isn't it?"
# yasmin "But I love that. This is so me."
# yasmin "This is officially my new favourite mode of transport."
# Somewhere in the distance, you can hear two birds calling to each other as they take flight.

# Bill looks a little awkward. He keeps opening and closing [his_her] mouth like he wants to say something but can't quite get there.
# Choiceseb "I wonder what he wants to say..."
# -Kiss [him_her] to give him time to think
# You put your arms around him and press up close to his body.
# Bill plants a gentle kiss on your lips, but you kiss him back harder, stroking the back of his neck with your fingers.
# When you finally break apart, breathless, Bill smiles at you.

# -Wait it out
# You tilt your head, waiting for him to speak.
# s3_mc "It's not like you to stumble over your words."
# bill "Yeah, I know."
# He smiles.
# bill "It's just the effect you have on me."

# -Try to guess what he's going to say
# Choiceseb "Don't tell me..."
# -You've decided to join the circus
# Bill laughs. 
# bill "No, though I'd be bloody good at the whole..."
# bill "...circus...ing?"
# s3_mc "Really?"
# bill "Yup. No fear of heights. I'm sure I could learn all that trapeze stuff on the job."
# s3_mc "You think so?"
# bill "Of course."
# bill "Well, maybe."

# -You want to tell me my penguins count as fish
# bill "Come on, I know I have strong opinions, but that..."
# He stops and looks thoughtful for a second.
# bill "Hmm, actually... they can't fly. And they do spend a lot of time in the water..."
# s3_mc "I was kidding! Penguins can't be fish. They love on land as well as in the water."
# bill "So... penguins are frogs?"
# s3_mc "Not sure that works either!"

# -You've only been pretending to like me for a bet
# bill "No chance!"
# bill "That's one bet I'd lose immediately."
# bill "I'm rubbish at lying."
# bill "And I hate playing games with people."
# s3_mc "Except Captain Chicken's Galactic Command."
# You both laugh. Bill touches your shoulder gently.

# bill "There's actually something I wanted to tell you."
# bill "But it's difficult to say."
# bill "Ok, here goes."
# There's an awkward pause.
# bill "I ate a peach."
# s3_mc "But you said they were just apples being extra!"
# bill "That's right."
# bill "Turns out... I was wrong."
# Choiceseb "Bill ate a peach... and admitted he was wrong"
# -It's just a peach
# bill "It's not just about the peach. It's about what it represents, innit."
# bill "I changed my mind about something. That's big. And there's a big reason."

# -Did you lose a bet?
# bill "Nope. There's another reason."

# -I never thought that would happen
# bill "I know. Me neither."

# bill "It's you."
# bill "Before I met you, there's no way, I'd have ever changed my opinion about anything, pretty much."
# bill "But you've inspired me to be open and try new things."
# Choiceseb "Bill says I've inspired him..."
# -Don't change too much
# s3_mc "I like you for being you. Your opinions are one of the things that first attracted me to you!"
# He smiles warmly.
# bill "That's... genuinely one of the nicest things anyone's said to me."

# -I wonder what else I can change your mind on?
# s3_mc "Maybe we'll even get you to visit America one day!"
# bill "Yeah, maybe..."
# bill "As long as they don't try to make me eat a salad with meat in it."

# -You've had a good effect on me, too
# s3_mc "I love the way you stick to your convictions."
# s3_mc "It's made me want to do that more."
# He grins at you.
# bill "That's great to hear."

# You put your arms around him and give him a hug. He squeezes back.
# You stay like that for a while, cuddled close to one another.

# harry "MC, there's something I've been meaning to talk to you about."
# Choiceseb "Harry has something he wants to say..."
# -If you're breaking up, this is a really bad timing
# -There's something I want to say as well
# -Is it about FuryStone?
# He laughs.
# harry "No."
# harry "But I did come up with a new combo this morning that I think could be pretty good..."
# harry "It basically involves feeding a lot of Skeleton Rats to a Suspiciously Large Cat, then using a Catapult of Questionable Effectiveness to throw the SLC at the opponent."

# harry "But anyway..."
# harry "What I really wanted to talk to you about was this."
# He gestures around vaguely.
# Choiceseb "You mean... (no further reactions)"
# -The sky?
# -The clouds?
# -That seagull?

# He laughs.
# harry "No, I mean, so..."
# harry "You know how I told you I approach stuff like a game?"
# s3_mc "One you have to win?"
# harry "Yeah. Exactly."
# harry "I never thought I would see beyond that, but... I'm not worried about that anymore."
# Choiceseb "Harry said he's not worried about winning anymore..."
# -Because you've rigged it so we'll win?
# -Because you think we're going to lose?
# harry "No. Actually, the opposite."

# -Because an asteroid's about to hit the Villa?
# H. What? Where did you hear that?
# s3_mc "Just kidding!"
# harry "Phew..."

# harry "I wanted to say, you make me feel like all that doesn't matter."
# harry "As long as I walk out of here with you, everything else is a bonus."
# harry "I love hanging out with you and sharing more of myself with you. I just want that. I just want us."
# H. I can't wait to actually get out and be a real couple with you.
# Choiceseb "Harry said that being with me is the real prize..."
# -Hug him
# -Squeeze his hand
# -Kiss him
# You go to kiss him, and he moves towards you at the same time. Your lips meet and the world disappears.

# You don't know how long you stay like that, oblivious to anything but each other, but it's a long time.

# You and Camilo fall together without a word, both of you just wanting to be as close to each other as possible.
# With your arms around him, it feels for a moment like nothing in the world matters.
# camilo "Do you remember when we were talking about my job the other day, and I said I had a secret ambition?"
# s3_mc "Yes."
# camilo "Yeah. I think I might be ready to share it..."
# Choiceseb "Camilo might tell me his dream job..."
# -Er, you know we're on TV, right?
# -What changed your mind?
# -I'm honoured that you trust me
# camilo "Well, to tell you the truth, it's actually not so much about me trusting you."
# s3_mc "Gee, thanks."
# camilo "No, I don't mean it like that!"

# camilo "But the reason I'm OK with saying it out loud is 100% down to you."
# camilo "I guess the reason I didn't want to say it out loud is I didn't want to admit that there was something I wanted more than working in the shop."
# camilo "But you helped me realise that I don't need to be responsible for everyone all the time."
# camilo "I love my friends and family to bits, but I've got to be happy in myself as well."
# camilo "I have my own stuff that I want, that's OK."
# s3_mc "I'm so happy for you."
# camilo "I think when I leave here, I'm gonna see if one of my sisters can take over for me."
# camilo "And I'll try and pursue something I've been thinking about for a while."
# s3_mc "Well, don't keep me in suspense! What is it?"
# camilo "Guess."
# Choiceseb "What could Camilo's dream job be? (no further reactions)"
# -Love Island narrator
# -Ballroom Dancer
# -Astronaut

# camilo "No way, bruv!"
# He laughs, but then starts to look thoughtful.
# camilo "Although, I reckon I'd enjoy it."
# s3_mc "That's why I suggested it!"
# camilo "That's not it, though."
# camilo "I'm actually really into salsa dancing. I'm pretty good."
# s3_mc "Wow! So you want to be a dancer?"
# camilo "Not exactly."
# camilo "Dancing really helped me when I was a kid."
# camilo "It's not just good for coordination and that - I met a lot of different people doing it."
# camilo "And I thought it'd be cool to teach other kids."
# camilo "I just wanna give back to my community in some way, you feel me?"
# Choiceseb "Camilo wants to teach salsa to kids... (no further reaction)"
# -You could use the Love Island Prize money to set it up
# -Maybe I could help you?
# -I think that's fantastic.

# Camilo smiles at you, and reaches out to softly touch your face.
# camilo "You know what I think? I think you're fantastic."
# Choiceseb "That was nice of him to say..."
# -Make a joke
# -Return the compliment
# -Kiss him
# Your lips meet his, and the world melts away. You're surrounded by the smell of his cologne, sweet and spicy.
# Camilo strokes your hair, then runs his hands down the small of your back. He makes a small sound of complete contentment.

# aj "Hey, MC."
# aj "You know what I was saying earlier about, like, pushing people away because I was actually scared they'd be bored of me?"
# s3_mc "Yeah."
# aj "Well, I wanted to say thank you."
# aj "I've been thinking about it a lot and I honestly blame you."
# s3_mc "You blame me?"
# aj "No, sorry. That came out wrong."
# aj "I blame you for making me realise that it was OK to, like..."
# aj "Let myself fall for someone."
# aj "Even if there was a risk I could get hurt."
# She sighs.
# aj "I don't let myself fall in love because I'm just scared of getting hurt when you land."
# aj "And that's why I always used to, like, push people away and not open up."
# aj "Because I was scared."
# aj "But falling for you was worth the risk."
# aj "And I just wanted to say thank you for, like, giving me that confidence."
# s3_mc "Aw, AJ!"
# Choiceseb "That's..."
# -A little confusing
# -Exactly how I feel as well
# s3_mc "It's hard to put ourselves in a vulnerable position, but you've made me feel safe enough to do so."

# -So sweet. I'll catch you when you fall for me!
# aj "I think I've already fallen pretty far."

# aj "I don't think I've ever felt this many feels for someone before."
# She smiles at you.
# Choiceseb "I should..."
# -Tell her she overthinks things
# -Hug her tightly
# -Kiss her passionately
# You put your hand behind the nape of her neck and lead her in towards your lips.
# She instinctively closes her eyes and kisses you.
# Her lips are as soft as ever. Her hands explore your body.
# She bites your lips slightly. The variation of pressure sends shivers down your spine.
# You follow suit and nibble her gently. She moans with pleasure.
# As you become enveloped in each other's touch, the whole world melts away.
# aj "Wow!"
# aj "Totally worth it!"

# aj "I hope we can, like, be together outside."
# aj "I know it'll be different, but I just can't wait for whatever the future has in store for us."

# Tai combs his fingers through his hair, looking thoughtful for a moment.
# When he catches you watching, he flips his hair over his shoulder, then pouts like a model from a shampoo advert.
# tai "Wanna have hair as hot as mine?"
# tai "Try My Tai."
# tai "The best conditioner you'll ever use."
# tai "You think I've got an advertising career ahead of me?"
# Choiceseb "Would I buy a conditioner called 'My Tai'?"
# -Isn't that a cocktail?
# -Show off your own hair
# -I'll try a My Tai any day
# s3_mc "You've got your brand sorted."
# s3_mc "Anyone would buy that."
# s3_mc "You just need a shirtless photo of you on the bottle."
# tai "That's my next career planned out. (you get 😍 with Tai)"

# He pauses, looking into your eyes, and smiles.
# tai "You're stunning."
# tai "Not just how you look. The whole package. All of you."
# tai "I could kiss you all over, if you wanted."
# Choiceseb "Would I like Tai to kiss me all over?"
# -Just on the cheek
# -Not right now
# -Ooh, yes
# s3_mc "What are you waiting for?"
# Tai grins and draws you into his arms. His body against yours spreads a feeling of safety through you.
# He ducks his head to kiss along the sensitive skin on your neck, then down to your shoulder.
# His lips are wonderfully soft. He makes a pleased noise in the back of his throat as he kisses you back up your neck.
# He teases you, kissing your cheeks but his lips are not quite touching yours. When he draws back, he gives you a cheeky smile.
# tai "That was just a taster."
# He sighs happily.

# tai "I was just thinking."
# tai "Are you looking forward to seeing your family again, after the Villa?"
# Choiceseb "Am I looking forward to seeing my family?"
# -Not so much
# -I'd rather see my friends
# s3_mc "I can't wait to tell them all about the Villa."
# s3_mc "And everyone I've met."
# tai "Hope I'll get to see them too."

# -Yeah, it'll be great
# s3_mc "I can't wait to tell them all about the Villa."
# s3_mc "And everyone I've met."
# tai "Hope I'll get to see them too."

# tai "If you meet my dad, I bet he'll try and prank you. I just know it."
# tai "But don't worry. I'll give you all his tells."
# s3_mc "His tells?"
# tai "When he's messing around, he smiles more. Like this."
# Tai gives you a big grin.
# Choiceseb "Tai says his dad does a big grin when he's messing around..."
# -Thanks for the tip
# tai "No worries. I mean, he'll prank you anyway."

# -That's just your normal smile!
# tai "Is it?!"
# s3_mc "Yeah, you do that exact grin all the time."
# tai "Do I?"

# -I'll prank him back
# s3_mc "This sounds like a challenge."
# s3_mc "I'll be the best prankster in New Zealand."
# tai "Good luck to you is all I'm saying."

# tai "Last prank war, I had to surrender or I'd miss my flight to London."
# tai "Not my finest hour."
# Tai runs his fingers through his hair again, looking like he's not really thinking about it.
# He leans closer to you, and when he speaks again, his voice is quieter.
# tai "It's funny thinking what it'll be like when we leave."
# tai "It'll be really different."
# tai "Do you think you'll like it?"
# Choiceseb "Will I like being out of the Villa?"
# -I'll miss everyone
# -I want my own bedroom again
# s3_mc "Not hearing everyone's snoring will be amazing."
# s3_mc "I've been literally dreaming about my bedroom."
# .
# -Everything will be different
# s3_mc "It'll be such a change."
# s3_mc "Not just a change from the Villa to home. But from before to after."

# Tai runs a fingertip around and around your palm.
# tai "Maybe I can join you there once you've settled in"
# tai "I know one thing that won't change."
# tai "How into you I am."

# ciaran "Hey, MC."
# ciaran "Since it's our last day here, I think you should know."
# ciaran "I'm falling for you. Hard."
# He bites his lip.
# ciaran "I'm sorry if that's a lot to put on you. But it's the truth."
# ciaran "I thought you should know before we leave."
# Choiceseb "How do I react?"
# -Play your cards close to your chest
# -Tell him you feel the same
# s3_mc "Ciaran, I feel the same."
# ciaran "That's incredible. (you get ❤️ with Ciaran)"
# ciaran "Blimey, how did I get so lucky?"
# ciaran "I mean, you're beautiful, you're funny, how could I NOT fall for you?"
# ciaran "I'm surprised you don't have the whole world wrapped around your finger."
# s3_mc "Who says I don't?"
# ciaran "Touche."
# ciaran "You know, you could have had anyone in here. And you picked me. A soppy lad from Waterford."
# ciaran "It's impossible to feel down, knowing that."
# (if you chose the gem choice from day 6 part 1 to go on a tour with Ciaran):
# s3_mc "And just last week you asked me if I like like you."
# ciaran "What a melt."
# s3_mc "It was cute."
# ciaran "Thanks..."

# ciaran "This has been such a good experience for me. In Waterford, people liked me, but I always thought once I got outside, people wouldn't."
# ciaran "Like, in Waterford they all had an obligation to like me, 'cos they knew my ma, or lived next door."
# ciaran "But you, Tai, the public... it's just me you like."
# Choiceseb ""
# -I only like you 'cos I know your ma
# -I'm glad you see yourself like I see you
# ciaran "I'm glad, too."
# ciaran "You make me feel like I can do anything."

# ciaran "You know, there's over 100,000 words of Captain Kerry stories on my phone."
# ciaran "Maybe I can do something with that..."
# Choiceseb "Ciaran wants to be a writer!"
# -Being a bouncer is hotter
# -Yes! Do it!
# s3_mc "That's a great idea!"
# ciaran "Really? OK! I'll look into it!"
# ciaran "Maybe they could be a children's book or something."
# ciaran "I always imagined reading them to our kids."
# ciaran "My kids. Some kids. Any kids. Not anyone's specific..."
# ciaran "Oh bloody hell."
# ciaran "Forget I said that."

# ciaran "Can you imagine, though? Kerry would be famous!"
# ciaran "We could get her that organic dog food you can't get at supermarkets."
# ciaran "...the stuff you have to get delivered."
# ciaran "That would be the life."
# s3_mc "You could probably get yourself some nice food, too."
# ciaran "Yeah, but I like rubbish food. Fancy for me is adding fish to my chips order."
# ciaran "What do you think?"
# Choiceseb "What's my idea of good food?"
# -Lobster thermidor
# -Home cooked
# -Takeaway
# s3_mc "Greasy pizza, all the way."
# ciaran "The lack of effort makes it taste all the better."
# ciaran "We can work our way around all types of cuisine, starting tomorrow."

# Choiceseb "Yasmin's going to sing the song she's written for me! (no further reactions)"
# -I'll be giving out marks out of ten, so be careful
# -It doesn't have to be good if it comes from the heart
# -I'm sure it'll be great

# -I don't care, just finish the song!
# -You could rhyme it with 'ham' instead
# -I think it works really well
# s3_mc "They're almost the same. I didn't even notice it wasn't a perfect rhyme."
# yasmin "Well, that's a relief."
# yasmin "Now I wish I hadn't even brought it up!"

# She takes a breath before singing the final lines.
# yasmin "'You make things beautiful just by being there...'"
# yasmin "'... And I would follow you anywhere.'"
# When it's over, she looks away and bites her lip.
# thought "That's the song she's been writing for me!"
# Choiceseb "That was..."
# -A bit underwhelming
# -Very nice, babe
# -So beautiful
# yasmin "You liked it?"
# s3_mc "Yas, it was beautiful. Thank you so much."
# s3_mc "You're really talented."
# She blushes, smiling broadly. (you get 😍 with Yasmin)

# She tucks some hair behind her ear and looks up at you with big, dark eyes.
# Choiceseb "She looks really pretty..."
# -Not right now
# -Kiss her cheek
# You tilt your head and give her a little kiss on one cheek, just below her eye.
# She giggles.
# yasmin "That was nice."

# -Kiss her forehead
# You brush her hair aside to give her a little kiss on the forehead.
# She giggles.
# yasmin "That was nice."

# Rafi's eyes light up with a smile. He reaches out and strokes down your cheek, feather-soft.
# Shivers tremble across your skin.
# thought "This feels so nice..."
# Choiceseb "Maybe I could kiss him...?"
# -Kiss Rafi gently
# You run your fingertips along Rafi's cheek, and his eyes half-close with bliss.
# Leaning in, you trace your lips along the same pace, then, achingly slowly, move to his mouth.
# Rafi kisses you back with feather-light touches, sending shivers along your skin.
# When he draws back, his cheeks are flushed.

# -Smile back
# Rafi's eyes spark with delight.

# -Kiss Rafi passionately
# You pull Rafi close, and he makes a delighted noise as you run your hands through his hair.
# He holds you tight, his warm hands drifting down your back.
# He kisses you with such passion that it leaves your lips tingling.
# When he draws back, his cheeks are flushed.

# R: MC, you're an absolute knockout.
# R: I can't wait to spend even more time with you once the summer's over.
# Choiceseb "Raif wants to spend more time with me after the summer..."
# -I'll want my space
# s3_mc "I'm looking forward to chilling out."
# s3_mc "Imagine having my own room again..."
# R: Mm, bliss.

# -Let's stay here...
# s3_mc "I'd be happy sticking around here forever."
# s3_mc "It's always summer in the Villa, right?"
# R: Yep, the Villa's its own little microclimate.
# R: It's like LA, but without as many yoga studios.

# -I want as much time with you as possible
# s3_mc "I can't wait."
# s3_mc "Imagine having our own room..."
# R: Mm, perfect for getting up to...
# He flickers his tongue over his teeth.
# R: Whatever we want.

# Rafi takes your hand and traces patterns on your palm with his fingertip. He looks almost nervous.
# R: Maybe you'd like to meet my brother after we're finished here?
# R: And my parents?
# Choiceseb "Raif's asking me to meet his family..."
# -Isn't it a bit soon?
# s3_mc "We haven't been coupled up for that long..."
# s3_mc "It might be a bit full on to meet your family right away."
# R: Oh, yeah, of course.
# R: Maybe in the future!

# -Shall I bring baklava?
# s3_mc "The important thing is that there's enough baklava for everyone."
# s3_mc "We can't have anyone going hungry!"
# R: That's the way to their hearts! (you get 😍 with Rafi)
# R: It'll be love at first sight.

# -I'd like that
# s3_mc "If they're anything like you, they'll be great."
# R: That's brilliant! (you get 😍 with Rafi)

# Rafi slides an arm around your waist, and squeezes you tight.
# R: It's kind of strange thinking about it.
# R: I haven't actually brought anyone to meet my family before.
# R: I've had girlfriends before, obviously, but it's never really been serious enough to...
# R: ...take the plunge.
# Choiceseb "This would be the first time Rafi's brought someone to meet his family..."
# -Do you not get on?
# s3_mc "Do you not see your family much?"
# R: Oh, no, we hang out a lot!
# R: Especially me and my brother.

# -What's your family hiding...?
# s3_mc "This sounds mysterious. Why wouldn't you invite people home?"
# s3_mc "What are they hiding...?"
# s3_mc "Could they be planning a zoo heist?"
# R: Does that involve stealing animals from a zoo?
# s3_mc "Naturally."
# s3_mc "Your mum wants the squirrel monkey, your dad wants the warthog, your brother wants the giraffe..."
# R: As much as I'd like that to be true... (you get 😂 with Rafi)

# -No one was serious enough?
# s3_mc "You haven't been serious enough about anyone to let them meet the family?"
# R: That's probably it.
# R: I haven't really been with anyone in a major way.
# R: I've been so busy...

# R: It's not that we don't get on. I love seeing them.
# Rafi's voice grows warmer and softer as he talks.
# R: I want to make sure the girl they meet is the right one for me, you know?
# R: And maybe that's happened here.
# Choiceseb "Rafi thinks I'm the right girl for him..."
# -What's the best way to convince them?
# -The jury's out on that
# s3_mc "Let's not rush things."
# s3_mc "Things are great as they are."
# R: Oh, you're right about that.

# -I'm the right girl for you
# s3_mc "We're good together."
# s3_mc "I'm sure your family will see that."
# R: Oh, I'm sure you're right.

# Rafi leans in and kisses your forehead. His beard smells faintly of rose oil.
# R: Either way, you look marvellous. That's the most important thing.
# s3_mc "What about you looking marvellous?"
# R: Oh, yes. You look marvellous and I look marvellous. The two most important things.

# Lily gives you a smouldering look and a slow smile.
# L: You look incredible, doll.
# L: I don't know how I keep my hands off you.
# Her gaze drifts to your mouth.
# Choiceseb "Lily looks like she'd like to kiss me..."
# -Lean away
# -Give Lily a hug
# -Kiss Lily
# You draw Lily close. When you kiss her, she melts against you, kissing you back deeply.
# You savour the heat of her body against yours as her deft fingers slide down your neck, towards your chest.
# When she draws back, her eyes are sparkling.
# L: That's just what I needed.

# She glances away and automatically checks her phone.
# s3_mc "No text?"
# L: No text.
# L: I keep thinking I hear my phone, even though it's not here.
# L: And every time I hear a Love Island text, I think it's my sister.
# L: She's always nagging about when I'm settling down, what I'll do after uni...
# L: It's a pain in the neck.
# Choiceseb "Lily's sister's always texting her, but Lily doesn't like it..."
# -It's annoying getting texts all the time
# -You could put your phone on silent...
# -It probably means she cares
# Lily tips her hand from side to side.
# L: You're probably right.
# L: But she could stand to express it differently.

# L: Her wedding prep has been a nightmare. It makes the Island look chill.
# L: I got added to a text chain about black pudding.
# s3_mc "Just... black pudding?"
# L: It's a controversial topic. Apparently. How much garlic. How thick you slice it. What you fry it in.
# L: Weddings are so much drama.
# Choiceseb "Lily thinks weddings are dramatic..."
# -I totally agree
# -The drama's the fun part
# -What if the drama's about you?
# s3_mc "You like being the centre of attention..."
# s3_mc "Have you never wanted to run in shouting “I object”?"
# Lily laughs, and squeezes your hand.
# L: Sounds like fun... (you get 😂 with Lily)
# L: But my sister would disown me.
# L: Considering the fuss she made over the black pudding, she'd never forgive me...

# Lily brushes a strand of hair back from her face in an unusually quiet moment.
# She meets your eyes again, then smiles and leans forward with a devious expression.
# L: You what would make the wedding party better?
# L: You.
# L: My sister's been asking if I had a plus one for forever.
# Choiceseb "Lily doesn't have a plus one for her sister's wedding..."
# -Would the black pudding stay away from me?
# -Meeting the family so soon?
# -I bet your wedding outfit's hot
# s3_mc "I'd love to see you all dressed up for the party."
# Lily leans close, and nuzzles against the side of your neck.
# L: I could give you a private viewing.

# Choiceseb "Do I want to go with Lily to her sister's wedding?"
# -It'd be a bit much for me
# -I'll outshine everyone!
# -I'll be there
# s3_mc "I'll come along with you."
# s3_mc "We'll have a great time."
# Lily kisses you soundly on the cheek.
# L: Babe, you're a star.
# L: I'm looking forward to it already.
# L: Plus, the free food's gonna be immense.

# As the sun dips below the horizon, stars start to come out and twinkle all around you.

# (MC recoupled with Rafi/Lily):
# R/L: I know it's still early days for us.
# R/L: But I just wanted to say...
# R/L: I'm so, so glad I met you. And there's nobody else I'd rather be leaving Love Island with.
# R/L: Whatever happens in the final, I really see a future for us outside the Villa.
# Choiceseb "Rafi/Lily thinks we have a future outside the Villa..."
# -It's too soon to say that
# s3_mc "I like you, but you said it yourself. We haven't known each other that long."
# s3_mc "It's too early to know how things will go for us when we leave here."
# R/L: You're right. I'm getting carried away.

# -Shh, let's just enjoy this moment
# R/L: You're right. I'm getting carried away.

# -It's going to be amazing
# s3_mc "I can't wait, babe."

# C/aj "Gah, I'm sorry! It's just words. It shouldn't be this hard."

# [he_she] laughs in surprise.
# Liona "I think that might be moving a little bit too fast!"
# Liona "How about sticking with girlfriend for now, then we can talk about marriage in a week or two, hmm?"
# s3_mc "Alright. Girlfriend it is, for now."

# [his_her] face breaks into a huge smile. (you get 😍 with LI)

# B/H/T/Cam/yasmin "I don't know what to say now. You've just made my entire year."
# s3_mc "It's OK. You don't have to say anything."
# [he_she] squeezes you close and presses a kiss to your forehead.
# The two of you stand close together, taking in the view.
# By now the landscape is dark, while the sky is sparkling with thousands of stars.
# The only sound is the distant sighing of the ocean.
# (MC sticking with former partner):
# Liona "My MC... my girlfriend."

# "Though you did get MC to agree to be your girlfriend, which proves you can sometimes get what you want."
# "Let's get our two lovebirds down from their date before it gets too dark for them to find the Villa again..."

# You and LI return to the Villa hand in hand.
# The other Islanders greet you excitedly.
# M/iona "There you are!"
# M/iona "Did you already change out of your date outfit? "
# s3_mc "Um, no. This is what I wore for the date."
# M/iona "Oh! Right."

# M/iona "You look stunning, babes. That's the perfect look for a special date."
# AJ/Y(MC coupled with AJ or AJ walked): How was it?
# seb "Did you go spelunking?"
# s3_mc "What?"
# L(L+N) / R(R+E): We've got a bet on. Seb thinks your special date was spelunking. I don't even really know what it is.
# L(L+N) / R(R+E): I guessed you went on a canoe.
# Liona "Close! It was a hot air balloon."
# L(L+N) / R(R+E):  How is that close?
# genevieve "Wow! A hot air balloon? I would've been so scared!"
# Choiceseb "The hot air balloon..."

# text "Islanders, the public have been voting for which couples they would like to see in the final. Please make your way to the firepit, where two couples will be dumped from the island."

# Liona "Don't worry, MC."
# Liona "Whatever happens, we'll still have each other."

# -Let's stay positive, guys
# s3_mc "This is how it always goes."
# s3_mc "There's nothing we can do now except face it, together."
# Liona "MC's right."
# Liona "Whatever happens, we'll still have each other."

# N(L+N) / E(R+E): Come on, then. We'd better head to the firepit.

# All the Islanders gather round the firepit to wait for the first text.
# The couples sit close together, talking nervously among themselves.
# LI turns to you and whispers.
# Liona "Do you think we'll be OK?"
# R/L: I mean, we haven't been together very long...(MC recoupling with Rafi/Lily)
# Liona "After everything that happened with Rafi and Lily, I think we've proven that we're a pretty strong couple.(MC sticking with former partner)"
# Liona "But you never know how the public's gonna vote...(MC sticking with former partner)"

# Liona "Alright. Trying to stay positive."

# Liona "We did just become the first official couple in the Villa. That's got to count for something.(MC sticking with former partner and agreeing to be their girlfriend)"

# Genevieve takes a deep breath.
# genevieve "The first couple to be dumped from the Island is..."

# You turn to LI and offer [him_her] a sneaky fistbump.

# -Nah
# LI nudges you.

# (AJ):

# ciaran "I feel like I've started opening up this whole world outside Waterford. It's so exciting."
# Harry):
# He neatly folds a shirt and adds it to the pile in his case.
# harry "I was like, this is gonna totally change my life."
# harry "Make me the cool, famous, successful person I always wanted to be, y'know?"
# s3_mc "And has it?"
# He laughs.
# harry "I don't know. It's definitely made me more grown-up, which is a start, I guess."
# [he_she] closes the case and looks back up at you.
# AJ/Y/C/T/harry "And I met you, of course."
# (MC was coupled with any of them at one point):
# AJ/Y/C/T/harry "...It's weird to think we used to be coupled up, isn't it?"
# AJ/Y/C/T/harry "Do you think we... like, I don't wanna drag all that back up again now, but..."
# AJ/Y/C/T/harry "Do you ever wonder what it might've been like? If you and I had stayed together?"
# Choiceseb "If me and AJ/Yasmin/Ciaran/Tai/Harry had stayed together..."
# -How about a goodbye kiss, then?
# s3_mc "You know... for old times' sake?"
# AJ/Yasmin/Ciaran/Tai/Harry looks at you in silence for a moment.
# Then [he_she] slowly walks round the bed and steps close to you, looking deep in your eyes.
# AJ/Y/C/T/harry "For old times' sake."
# [he_she] kisses you gently on the mouth. (you get ❤️ AJ/Yasmin/Ciaran/Tai/Harry)
# You can feel yourself starting to get lost in the kiss, until [he_she] quickly pulls away.
# [he_she] shakes [his_her] head and steps back over to [his_her] case as if nothing happened.
# AJ/Y/C/T/harry "You've got LI, anyway."

# -It could've been beautiful, yeah
# [he_she] smiles sadly.
# AJ/Y/C/T/harry "Oh well. Maybe in another life."
# AJ/Y/C/T/harry "You've got LI, anyway."

# -Nah, it was never going to work
# AJ/Y/C/T/harry "Yeah... maybe you're right."
# AJ/Y/C/T/harry "You've got LI, anyway."

# (MC was not coupled with any of them at one point):
# AJ/Y/C/T/harry "It's been real, MC. I see you as a friend, you know."
# Choiceseb "AJ sees me as a friend..."
# -That's putting it too strongly
# -We could have been more than friends
# s3_mc "Don't you think?"
# [he_she] looks at you in surprise.
# s3_mc "Well... maybe."
# s3_mc "But now you're leaving... I can't help wondering what it might've been like. You and me."
# AJ/Y/C/T/harry "MC... this is..."
# [he_she] sighs heavily and looks away.
# AJ/Y/C/T/harry "I guess now we'll never know."

# -Of course we're friends!
# s3_mc "We've been through so much together!"
# s3_mc "I'm really glad I met you, AJ/Yasmin/Ciaran/Tai/Harry."

# AJ/Y/C/T/harry "And, MC, before I go..."
# AJ/Y/C/T/harry "Can I tell you something about LI? (Lily as LI is missing)"
# s3_mc "What?"
# AJ/Y/C/T/harry "I don't have future vision, so I don't know if you're gonna win Love Island, or stay together, or any of that."
# aj "And I'm not the most experienced when it comes to relationships. But even I can see how [he_she] feels about you."
# yasmin "But [his_her] vibes are totally full of love every time he looks at you."
# ciaran "But... well, you're what my ma would call 'doing a strong line'. Which is a good thing."
# harry "And I'm not the most experienced when it comes to relationships. But even I can see how [he_she] feels about you."
# tai "But I've been around the block a few times, and I know real feelings when I see them."
# AJ/Y/C/T/harry "I know Bill/Harry/Yasmin might take himself a bit too seriously sometimes."
# AJ/Y/C/T/harry "I know Ciaran/Tai/AJ/Rafi/Camilo might joke around and forget to take things seriously sometimes."
# AJ/Y/C/T/harry "Don't mistake that for not caring about you, because [he_she] does. A lot."
# s3_mc "Thanks, AJ/Yasmin/Ciaran/Tai/Harry."
# AJ/Y/C/T/harry "As for how you'll do in the final, well..."
# AJ/Y/C/T/harry "I think you're a good person. You're the only person who came to wish me goodbye, anyway."
# AJ/Y/C/T/harry "And I think the public will see that too."
# s3_mc "I hope so."
# S[he_she] zips up her/his case with a sigh.
# AJ/Y/C/T/harry "I guess we should go down, then."
# Choiceseb "Yeah..."
# -Let's go down and find the others (no further reactions)

# -Let me carry your case for you
# AJ/Y/C/T/harry "Oh, there's no need...!"
# Before [he_she] can stop you, you lift [his_her] case in both hands and haul it towards the door.
# s3_mc "I wasn't asking! Come on!"
# AJ/Y/C/T/harry "Alright, alright! (you get 😍 with AJ/Yasmin/Ciaran/Tai/Harry)"
# AJ/Y/C/T/harry "You're a lot stronger than you look."

# -Give me a hug before we go
# You hold out your arms.
# [he_she] puts down her/his case and comes over to hug you tightly.
# AJ/Y/C/T/harry "I'm going to miss you, MC. (you get 😍 with AJ/Yasmin/Ciaran/ Tai/Harry)"
# s3_mc "I'm going to miss you too."
# When [he_she] releases you, [he_she] turns away quickly and subtly wipes her/his eyes on her wrist.
# AJ/Y/C/T/harry "Come on. Before they start wondering where we've got to."

# [he_she] picks up her/his case and follows you to the door.

# The two of you make your way down to the Villa entrance where the others are waiting.

# The Islanders are gathered by the entrance to say goodbye.
# Yasmin/AJ helps Ciaran/Harry with his case as he smiles round at you all.
# C/harry "Bye, then, everyone. It's been great getting to know you all."
# C/harry "You really are a lovely bunch."
# He puts his arm round Yasmin/AJ and smiles.
# C/harry "I'm taking the loveliest one away with me, though."
# Yasmin/AJ laughs and hugs him back.
# Y/aj "Bye, everyone! We'll miss you!"
# Choiceseb "Yasmin/AJ and Ciaran/Harry are leaving..."
# -Yeah, whatever, bye then
# -Can I have the pillows off your bed?
# s3_mc "I mean, since you won't be using them anymore..."
# C/harry "Er, yeah, sure."
# Y/aj "I hope they make you comfortable."
# Y/aj "Just to warn you, though..."
# Y/aj "Ciaran's/Harry's totally drooled on them."
# C/harry "No I haven't!"
# Y/aj "Come on, babe, it's nothing to be ashamed of. I just think MC deserves to know."

# -I'll miss you both so much!
# s3_mc "I miss you already!"
# Y/aj "You too, MC!"
# C/harry "We won't forget you."

# They take their cases and step back, giving AJ/Ciaran(MC coupled with AJ/Yasmin) and Tai/Harry a chance to say goodbye.
# AJ/C(MC coupled with AJ/Yasmin): Bye, everyone!
# AJ/C(MC coupled with AJ/Yasmin): Take care of each other. Don't get too competitive when the final rolls around.
# AJ/C(MC coupled with AJ/Yasmin): Remember, winning isn't more important than the connections we've all made with each other.
# genevieve "That's so sweet, AJ/Ciaran(MC coupled with AJ/Yasmin)."
# seb "I was gonna say sentimental..."
# T/harry "Come on, you big softie, don't pretend you're not just a little bit heartbroken to see us go."
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): Of course he is. We all are.
# Choiceseb "Everyone's sad to see AJ and Tai/Harry go..."
# -Honestly, I'm amazed you lasted this long
# -Less competition for me and LI in the final!
# -It won't be as much fun here without you guys
# s3_mc "The Villa's gonna feel empty without you here."
# AJ/C(MC coupled with AJ/Yasmin): Oh, MC.
# T/harry "C'mere. (you get 🥰 with AJ/Ciaran(MC coupled with AJ/Yasmin) and Tai/Harry)"
# Both of them hug you tight. Tai/Harry affectionately musses up your hair before stepping away.

# AJ/C(MC coupled with AJ/Yasmin): Well, I guess we'd better be off.
# Y/AJ(MC coupled with Yasmin): Bye, everyone!
# C/harry "Bye! (MC coupled with Yasmin, it's Harry)"
# T/harry "We'll miss you! (MC coupled with Yasmin, it's Tai)"
# All waving, they walk off down the driveway, dragging their cases behind them.
# LI puts an arm around your waist and sighs.
# Liona "How are you feeling, babe?"
# Choiceseb "I'm mostly feeling..."
# -Sad about the dumping
# s3_mc "It was so sudden. I can't take it in."
# Liona "I know. Me neither."

# -Excited for whatever comes next
# s3_mc "Being here is like being on a rollercoaster."
# s3_mc "I can't wait to see where it takes us tomorrow."
# Liona "Me neither."

# -Still loved-up from our date
# s3_mc "It was so romantic. I'm still buzzing."
# Liona "Honestly? Me too."

# Liona "We've only got a couple of more days left before the final. That's kind of scary."
# MC recoupling with Rafi/Lily):
# R/L: But at least I'm going into it with you.
# (MC sticking with former partner and agreeing to be their girlfriend):
# Liona "But at least I'm going into it with the best girlfriend I could've asked for."
# Together with the rest of the Islanders, you head back inside the Villa and to bed.
# "Next time on Love Island..."
# M/iona "Oh my gosh, the prom!"
# "And you know what that means."
# "Yes, all our Islanders are finally, finally, going to change their outfits."
# "And if anyone out there is desperate to see MC and LI trying to slow dance together, you're in luck."

# "And then there were eight."
# "We're hot off the back of a dumping here on Love Island today, where two couples were just sent home."
# Y/aj "Bye, everyone! We'll miss you!"
# "I'll miss you too, Yasmin."
# "If you ever watch this back, you were my favourite."
# "Oh, and please return my calls when you can."
# "You weren't supposed to take the bean bag with you. Or the hair-dryer."
# "Speaking of beans, this lot are full of 'em."
# M/iona "Oh my gosh! It's the prom!"
# "Oh, did I forgot to mention that?"
# "Tonight, the Islanders will be declaring their love, friendship, or mutual respect in front of six other strangers they met just a few weeks ago."
# "Love moves in mysterious ways, I always say."
# "One thing's for sure, we can't let them do it in their underwear, no matter how funny that'd be."
# "So you all know what that means..."
# genevieve "Shut the fridge door!"
# "...that's right, Viv. It's shopping time."

# As you're drifting in and out of sleep, you're awoken by the sound of a text somewhere in the room.
# thought "Was that someone's phone? What time is it?"
# There's a few murmurs from elsewhere in the room, but no one moves.
# You check your own phone, but there are no new messages.
# thought "Huh. I guess they'll text again if it's important."
# You turn to face LI. He's/She's snoring softly.
# You cuddle up a little closer and put your arm around [him_her]. [he_she] stops suddenly. One eye opens slowly.
# Liona "Hey."
# s3_mc "Hey."
# Liona "What's the time?"
# s3_mc "Absolutely no idea, but I'm sure I heard a phone go off just now..."
# Liona "Everyone asleep?"
# You crane your neck to check the rest of the room.
# As you do, LI plants a kiss on the back of your neck. Your hairs stand on end.
# s3_mc "Hey, no fair!"
# LI gives you a cheeky grin, but doesn't respond.
# Liona "It's so quiet in here that I can't even tell if anyone is up yet."
# s3_mc "You can say that again."
# Liona "I guess Harry might've gotten up to meditate. I don't see him. (only appears if Harry is coupled with Miki/Iona and was not dumped)"
# [he_she] sighs deeply.
# Liona "When people leave it's tough. But... I'm so glad we're still here. Together."
# Choiceseb "LI is really glad that we made it this far..."
# -I just really miss home
# Liona "Aw, MC... I know how you feel."
# Liona "But it'll be over soon."
# Liona "Win or lose, it doesn't really matter. As long as we're leaving together."
# [he_she] pulls you in for a warm cuddle.
# s3_mc "You're right. Thanks, LI."

# -I didn't think I would make it this far
# Liona "Honestly, I wasn't sure either. Obviously I came in trying to make a good impression, all confident like."
# Liona "But I realised pretty quickly that you're only ever one step away from being voted out."
# Liona "And there's a lot of luck involved with finding the right person."
# Liona "Anyway..."

# -Me too, babe
# LI smiles widely, but doesn't say anything more. (you get 😍 with LI)

# A few moments of quiet pass, while you listen to LI's heartbeat with your head on [his_her] chest.
# s3_mc "You're quiet this morning."
# Liona "Yeah. I guess there's just lots on my mind."
# Choiceseb "LI's got a lot on [his_her] mind..."
# -The dumping? Get over it, hun
# s3_mc "I mean, I know it's sad to lose your mates, but we're in the home stretch now."
# s3_mc "We have to keep our eyes on the horizon."
# s3_mc "And anyway... we'll see them soon enough at the afterparty!"
# Liona "Ha! True. No sense overthinking it now, is there?"

# -I have a lot on my mind too
# s3_mc "It's hard to lose your mates. You sort of don't really think it's happening until... bam! They're gone."
# Liona "Exactly. And now we're in the final. Somehow."
# s3_mc "Well, I wouldn't call it blind luck..."
# Liona "True. You are pretty great."

# -But we've made it to the final! Isn't that exciting?
# s3_mc "I mean, I know it's sad to lose your mates, but we're in the home stretch now."
# s3_mc "We have to keep our eyes on the horizon."
# s3_mc "And anyway... we'll see them soon enough at the afterparty!"
# Liona "Ha! True. No sense overthinking it now, is there?"

# You cuddle up to LI and just enjoy the silence for a few moments.
# (MC coupled with a girl):
# Your hand traces circles around her belly absently as you listen to her breathing.
# (Next scene and also the gem choice only appears if MC is coupled with a boy):
# thought "LI's thinking about the finale..."
# thought "It's still quiet. We might be the only ones awake."
# thought "I bet I can think of a few ways to cheer him up..."
# Choiceseb "Should we try and get some alone time in before everyone else wakes up?"
# -I think he could do with a distraction... (gem choice)
# -Maybe now's not the time
# thought "On the other hand... this might be one of our last chances."
# Choiceseb " And LI could do with a pick-me-up..."
# -Just quickly, before the others wake up (gem choice)
# -No, I just want to enjoy [his_her] company
# You hug him tightly, your head resting on his chest, and your fingers trace lazy circles across [his_her] skin.

# Gem choicelladine ""
# You pull LI closer to you, planting a series of kisses along his chest.
# Liona "MC?"
# s3_mc "You looked a bit distant."
# s3_mc "Thought I'd bring you back to the here and now."
# s3_mc "With this beautiful girl..."
# Liona "Talk about a wake-up call."
# You move your kisses slowly up his body. You feel his muscles tightening as you reach his neck.
# He exhales deeply as your free hand explores his body.
# Liona "You are too good at this."
# You find yourself edging closer to his mouth, exploring his neck and chin with your lips.
# You feel his cheeks grinning as you kiss [him_her].
# Choiceseb "He's really enjoying this..."
# -Kiss his lips
# You lean in, feeling his hot breath on your face. You savour the moment before leaning in for the kiss.
# His lips meet yours and a wave of excitement crashes through you. The kiss is passionate and quick. LI's arm comes around you to hold you as you're locked together.
# Eventually you pull away, grinning.

# -Take a moment to rest
# You take a minute to admire your handiwork. LI is breathing heavily, eyes facing the ceiling.

# -Tease him some more
# You smile at him in the darkness, and then return to kissing his neck, his pecs, and then his abs.
# Liona "Damn, MC."

# He lets out a deep sigh.
# Liona "You definitely know how to get me going."
# s3_mc "I'm glad you think so."
# The tips of his fingers trace your spine softly backwards and forwards as he talks.
# Liona "So..."
# You glance around the room. No one has moved from where they were earlier.
# s3_mc "I think they're all still asleep."
# Choiceseb "Do I want to take things further?"
# -That'll do for now
# s3_mc "Not for long, though, I imagine."
# s3_mc "We should probably leave it there."
# Liona "Agreed. We wouldn't want to be bad housemates, would we?"

# -I definitely want to have a little fun with LI
# s3_mc "That is, if you want to get a little louder?"
# A smile spreads across his lips.
# Liona "Is that a challenge?"
# s3_mc "If you're feeling... up for it?"
# You peck his lips once more, before sitting straight up.
# You straddle his waist and lean over him. There's a hungry look in his eyes.
# Liona "For you babe, always."
# LI initiates the kiss this time, and you feel him take control.
# Your thoughts and fears about the finale are quickly washed away as you lose yourself in his arms.
# The bedroom becomes a distant memory. All that you can think about is LI.
# genevieve "Mm. Hngh. Wha?"
# Liona "I think she heard us!"
# Choiceseb "Genevieve heard us..."
# -Tell [him_her] to stop
# -Keep going
# s3_mc "She's fine. Don't worry."
# You ignore Genevieve. Before LI can say any more, you kiss him on the lips again.
# Genevieve doesn't say anything, but sleepily turns over to face the other way.
# You continue as if nothing had happened.
# Eventually, you run out of steam, collapsing onto LI with a contented sigh.
# You let yourself relax for a moment, lying on LI's chest. His/ breathing is even more ragged than before.
# Liona "Well, that felt... good."
# Liona "If that's going to be your method for distracting me when I'm upset in the future..."
# s3_mc "Don't get used to it. I'm not doing that every time you pull a pulley-dog face on me."
# Liona "I know, I know."
# Liona "If only sex really could solve all our problems."
# s3_mc "The world would probably be a better place."
# [he_she] smiles weakly, clearly deep in thought.

# You hug him tightly, your head resting on his chest, and your fingers trace lazy circles across his skin.

# Just as you shut your eyes again, there's another noise from somewhere in the room.
# thought "Again?"
# seb "Whose phone is that?"
# N (L+N) / E (R+E): Some of us are still trying to sleep here.
# Suddenly the lights are turned on.
# Seb groans.
# You sit up and gaze around the room. Everyone is in varying states of wakefulness.
# Genevieve and Seb are still underneath the blankets, refusing to come out.
# Nicky/Elladine is turned away, facing the opposite wall, while Lily/Rafi is getting up and rubbing her eyes.
# Miki/Iona is fumbling to find her phone amongst the sheets...
# M/iona "Oh, it was me."
# M/iona "Whoops!"
# L(L+N) / R(R+E): Well go ahead, read it.
# M/iona "But everyone's still half in bed."
# Lily(N+L)/Rafi(R+E) starts clapping her/his hands.
# L(L+N) / R(R+E): Wakey, wakey! We got a text here.
# Everyone except for Nicky/Elladine starts to get out from underneath their duvets and pillows.
# Some are quicker than others.
# LI is quickly up and ready, clearly raring to go.
# M/iona "OK, so..."
# text "Rise and shine, Islanders. Today you'll be preparing for the prom! First, the girls will leave the Villa to choose their outfits, then you'll all need to prepare the speech that you'll give to your date tonight. #loveislandprom #lastnightinthevilla"
# M/iona "Oh my gosh, the prom! I almost forgot."
# M/iona "And we get to go shopping, nice!"
# genevieve "I can imagine a few of us could definitely do with some new clothes."
# seb "I hope that wasn't a dig."
# genevieve "You'll look good in a suit, babe, that's all I'm saying."
# Choiceseb "The prom is tonight! We have to choose outfits and write speeches."
# -This is a lot of pressure
# thought "I need to look my best tonight. And I don't know how good I am at writing a speech..."

# -LI better wear something nice
# thought "I really want to see [him_her] all dressed up. My heart is beating faster just thinking about it."

# -I'm not worried
# thought "I'll be fine. I look good, I talk good, what could go wrong?"

# L(L+N) / R(R+E): We'd better hurry, then. Like the text said, we've got to start on our speeches as soon as we get back. Time for breakfast?
# M/iona "Definitely."
# genevieve "Let's go."
# The Islanders hurry out of the room to start getting ready for their busy day.
# Nicky is still in bed, facing the wall.
# Liona "You coming, MC?"
# Choiceseb "Nicky/Elladine looks really upset. Maybe I should talk to him?"
# -Yeah, I'm coming now
# thought "Elladine/Nicky doesn't need me interfering right now."
# thought "She'll/He'll figure it out on her own."
# You get up and follow LI to the kitchen, leaving Elladine/Nicky to her/his thoughts.

# -I'll be with you in a minute, babe...
# s3_mc "You go on ahead."
# Liona "Sure thing."
# LI gives you a quick peck on the cheek, then leaves.
# You head over to Nicky/Elladine and sit on the bed beside [him_her].
# s3_mc "Hey."
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): Oh, hey.
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): Sorry. I guess you could tell I'm not really with it this morning.
# s3_mc "It's totally fine. This isn't easy for you."
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): Yeah, but...
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): It's not really fair on everyone else when I'm like this, either. Even for Lily/Rafi.
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): [he_she] had to pick someone. It's not really her/his fault I'm in this mess.
# Choiceseb "Nicky/Elladine says it's not Lily's/Rafi's fault that they're in this mess..."
# -[he_she] didn't have to break up the strongest couple...
# s3_mc "Like anyone else would have been better."
# (MC recoupling with Rafi/Lily):
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): What, like choosing “former partner”?
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): I seem to remember “former partner” explicitly shutting her/him down.
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): And I doubt anyone else would've appreciated being split up at that point either.
# (MC sticking with former partner):
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): Even you and LI?
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): I'm sure a lot of people would have been upset about that.
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): And I don't think Viv or Seb would want to be separated now either.

# -You're right, it's not her/his fault
# s3_mc "[he_she] had to choose someone, or just give up. Those aren't really good options either way."
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): Exactly.

# -[he_she] could have walked...
# s3_mc "That would have saved us all the drama.(MC recoupling with Rafi/Lily)"
# s3_mc "I mean, that's what Rafi/Lily did.(MC sticking with former partner)"
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): I'm not sure you can expect someone to do that just because we're all in couples.
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): What's the point in coming on the show if you're not going to try to win?
# s3_mc "To find love?"
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): It's a bit late in the game for that, now.
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): You've got to give it your best shot when you come in that late, as well.

# N(L+N) / E(R+E): There's no winning, really.
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): Which makes it hard to hold a grudge, but...
# s3_mc "You can't help but feel upset about Elladine/Nicky."
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): Yeah.
# Choiceseb "Nicky/Elladine is still thinking about Elladine/Nicky..."
# -I don't know, man/girl
# -You should move on, give it a go with Lily/Rafi
# s3_mc "There's not long left. Elladine/Nicky would want you to keep going."
# s3_mc "For better or for worse."

# -Maybe you guys can get together afterwards?
# s3_mc "Tell Lily/Rafi how you feel. She'll/He'll understand."
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): And in the meantime?
# s3_mc "Go to the prom with Lily/Rafi as friends, maybe?"

# N(L+N) / E(R+E): Thanks, MC. You're a good friend.
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): I'll think about it. You better head to breakfast.
# s3_mc "Any time, hun."
# You give Nicky/Elladine a brief hug, before heading off to the kitchen.

# You notice that Lily(N+L)/Rafi(E+R) is standing away from the group a little, focussed intently on a pair of over-fried eggs.

# L(L+N) / R(R+E): Oh shoot. Yeah.
# Lily/Rafi turns off the hob and starts to poke the burnt eggs with a spatula.

# s3_mc "Your head somewhere else?"
# L(L+N) / R(R+E): That obvious?
# L(L+N) / R(R+E): I've been trying to keep my cool, but...
# L(L+N) / R(R+E): Well, it's the prom. And you've seen me and Nicky/Elladine aren't exactly solid right now.
# s3_mc "I can imagine it's gotta be hard for you guys right now."
# L(L+N) / R(R+E): You could say that.
# L(L+N) / R(R+E): I'm jealous of you and Rafi/Lily to be honest. Picking someone worked out way better for [him_her] than for me.(MC recoupled with Rafi/Lily)
# L(L+N) / R(R+E): It's really hard coming in this late and having to break someone up. No wonder Rafi/Lily left.(MC sticking with former partner)
# s3_mc "You'll figure it out. You've got more charm than..."
# s3_mc "...a magic wand!"
# L(L+N) / R(R+E): Ha! Nice one. You use that one often?

# -Call her out for upsetting Nicky/Elladine
# s3_mc "Well. We're not all where we want to be."
# You stare at Lily/Rafi, who pretends not to notice.
# s3_mc "Nicky/Elladine looked miserable this morning. I hope Lily/Rafi realises she's/he's ruined [his_her] prom."
# seb "Woah! Easy there, MC."
# s3_mc "I'm just saying what we're all thinking."
# genevieve "Maybe we should let them sort it out on their own."

# -Ignore her/him
# thought "It's not my issue to deal with right now. Lily/Rafi and Nicky/Elladine will have to sort something out between them."

# Suddenly, the room goes silent, as you realise that Nicky/Elladine has just walked in.
# [his_her] eyes are red and puffy.
# nicky "Hey guys. Sorry I missed breakfast!"
# seb "No worries, mate! We're not done yet, anyway."

# N(L+N) / E(R+E): I know. It's OK. We don't need to tip-toe around the subject.
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): Obviously there's been a lot of tension since the recoupling. So I wanted to clear the air.
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): Lily/Rafi?
# Lily/Rafi looks up from her/his burnt eggs.
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): I know you had a tough choice to make. I don't blame you.
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): And... I know that if Elladine/Nicky was still here, she'd/he'd be telling me to stop feeling so sorry for myself and just get out there.
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): So that's what I'm doing.
# (MC telling Nicky/Elladine to give it a go with Rafi/Lily):
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): I had a think, and... well... it's not fair to you that I've been the way I was. You deserve a chance.
# (MC telling Nicky/Elladine “Maybe you guys can get together afterwards” or “I don't know”):
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): I thought about it, and I came to realise that Elladine/Nicky is who I want to be with.
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): When I get out, I'm going to pick up where we left off.
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): But that doesn't mean we can't be friends. Or that I need to be pieing you off all the time.
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): So...
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): Will you go to the Love Island prom with me, Lily?
# (MC telling Nicky/Elladine to give it a go with Rafi/Lily):
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): As my date.
# Lily's/Rafi's face lights up.
# L(L+N) / R(R+E): Aw, babe! Of course I will!
# Lily/Rafi jogs over to Nicky/Elladine and embraces [him_her]. They share a friendly kiss.

# L(L+N) / R(R+E): I'd love to go as friends.
# Lily/Rafi and Nicky/Elladine approach each other and share a friendly hug.
# Choiceseb "Nicky/Elladine and Lily/Rafi have made up for the prom..."
# -Good for them!
# thought "If it saves on drama later, I'm all for it!"

# -I wonder if Elladine/Nicky is watching...

# Your lips meet suddenly and the tension comes out all at once, like a wave crashing over you.
# Her arms fumble with the curtain behind her, struggling to pull it over while your hands explore her body.
# You take her head in your hands as you lean into the kiss, guiding her into the wall beside you.
# Soon she's up against it, your hands pinning hers to the wall as you plant kisses down her neck.
# She takes your head in your hands and leans into you. You let her take control as she guides you towards a wall.(Yasmin/Lily)

# Y/AJ/L We could have a bed, for starters.
# Yasmin/AJ/Lily gives you a devilish smile. Her finger traces your collarbone, before slowly making its way down your body.

# -We could
# s3_mc "It doesn't matter either way."
# s3_mc "I just want to be here with you."
# You kiss her on the lips.

# Choiceseb "What do I think of the girls' outfits?"
# -Some of us look better than others...
# -Girls... you all look so good!
# s3_mc "Like... so good..."
# s3_mc "I'm so happy and proud of you guys! We deserve to have a good time."
# genevieve "Yes! Absolutely! (you get 🙂 with Genevieve)"
# M/iona "One hundred percent."
# s3_mc "Shall we get back to them? We have speeches to prepare!"

# -Our boys are gonna faint when they see us (MC coupled with a boy)
# s3_mc "They have no idea what's about to hit them..."
# genevieve "Yes! Absolutely! (you get 🙂 with Genevieve)"
# M/iona "One hundred percent."
# s3_mc "Shall we get back to them? We have speeches to prepare!"

# -Yasmin's/AJ's/Lily's looking the best... no bias...
# s3_mc "I mean... just look at her."
# Y/AJ/L: Thanks, babe. But clearly you're the hottest one here. (you get 😏 with Yasmin/AJ)
# M/iona "Get a room, you two!"
# (not choosing the gem option for the changing room):
# Y/AJ/L: Maybe later...
# s3_mc "Don't make a girl a promise, unless you know you can keep it."
# Genevieve clears her throat loudly.
# genevieve "Ha! They already did..."
# L/elladine "Huh? Just now? Wow, you guys!"
# L/elladine "That's kinda hot."
# s3_mc "Moving swiftly on..."
# genevieve "Time to head back, you guys? Those speeches won't write themselves."

# L(N+L)/E(E+R): Totes. I still have no idea what I'm going to write, though.
# genevieve "I'm sure we can all help each other, right?"
# M/iona "Then let's go!"
# "You know what I say, Miki/Iona?"
# "It's not about what you write, it's all about the delivery."
# "I'm sure you all appreciate how I perform these outros with perfect timing and inflection."
# "I put a lot of effort in. It'd be a shame for it to go to waste."
# "What's next? Oh, right. The prom!"
# s3_mc "I can't believe it's almost prom!"
# "Thank you, MC! Right on cue."
# "Stick around, because you won't want to miss the speeches."

# "It's a gorgeous afternoon on our favourite Island of Love."
# "Well, the only Island of Love."
# "And our even more gorgeous heroes have been hard..."
# "Shopping!"
# s3_mc "This isn't going to be an easy decision..."
# genevieve "Would it be tacky if I said you look 'hashtag-flames'? Because you do."
# "And now we're drawing close to the Love Island event of the year!"
# M/iona "I've always wanted to do a human pyramid..."
# "Well, that too..."
# "I'm talking about prom!"
# genevieve "This means I need a speech."
# "That's right, Viv!"
# "I'm getting misty-eyes just thinking about it."
# "Or maybe that's from chopping up these onions."
# "I think we can all agree that grated onion makes for the perfect sandwich."
# "Just me?"
# "You lot need to think outside the lunchbox."

# "After her busy morning, MC is having some well earned chillout time."
# (the girls are back into their swimwear)
# "This is a holiday, after all."
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): ...I reckon I prefer them big.
# s3_mc "Nice and chunky."
# "Excuse me, MC?"
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): Yeah, fist-sized. Then you can really get a good taste.
# Genevieve pauses in the doorway with wide eyes.
# genevieve "What are we talking about, guys?"
# s3_mc "Balls..."
# s3_mc "...of mozzarella on pizza!"
# genevieve "Ohhh!"
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): Near my parents there's this incredible pizza place.
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): Sometimes I just order mozzarella balls and ketchup.
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): It's lush.
# Genevieve listens politely, but as Nicky's/Elladine's talking, she looks excited about something else.
# Choiceseb "Genevieve definitely has something else on her mind..."
# -Spit it out, girl
# s3_mc "What's got your knickers in a twist?"

# -You look like you need the loo
# s3_mc "You're hopping around like all the loos are engaged."
# s3_mc "What's up?"

# -Be patient, Viv
# s3_mc "We need to finish our important mozzarella discussion."
# genevieve "Oh, of course!"
# She looks very attentive.
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): I can't remember what I was saying now.
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): What's going on with you, babe?

# genevieve "Nothing...?"
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): She's hiding something for sure.
# Nicky/Elladine raises [his_her] hands to threatening claws.
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): Do we need to tickle you till you talk?
# Genevieve giggles.
# genevieve "I'm not even ticklish!"
# s3_mc "Foiled again."
# Genevieve comes to sit with the two of you.
# genevieve "So."
# Nicky/Elladine leans forward eagerly.
# (if MC told Genevieve that she's overthinking or “Whatever it is, I'm sure you'll be fine” during the shopping ):
# genevieve "Seb asked me to prom!"
# s3_mc "...and you said yes, right?"
# genevieve "Of course!"
# genevieve "He said he was nervous about asking in front of everyone, and he was putting it off till the right moment."
# genevieve "I'm so glad I chilled out about it."
# (if MC told Genevieve to ask Seb to prom during the shopping):
# genevieve "I asked Seb to the prom!"
# s3_mc "...and he said yes, right?"
# genevieve "Yes!"
# genevieve "He said he was nervous about asking in front of everyone, and he hadn't managed to find the right moment."
# genevieve "I'm so glad I took the plunge."
# genevieve "Thanks for the push, babe."
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): It's kind of nerve-wrecking for guys. There's this weird expectation that we'll always make the first move.
# genevieve "Exactly! It's not fair on anyone."
# Choiceseb "Seb was nervous about asking Genevieve to the prom..."
# -He was being a wimp
# s3_mc "I don't know why he was fussing."
# s3_mc "You both like each other, what's there to worry about?"

# -You're both adorable
# s3_mc "It's really lovely to see how much you care about each other."

# -It's hard to take that step
# s3_mc "Nicky's/Elladine's right. It is nerve-wrecking making a move, even if you know you like the other person."

# s3_mc "The most important thing is..."
# s3_mc "You've got a partner for prom!"
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): A partner for prom! (you get 🙂 with Nicky/Elladine)
# genevieve "A partner for prom! (you get 🙂 with Genevieve)"
# genevieve "Wait."
# genevieve "This means I need a speech."
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): You haven't written one already?
# genevieve "I was so preoccupied sorting out the asking part, I didn't get round to it!"
# Choiceseb "Now she mentions it, what's my speech status?"
# -Let's work on it together
# s3_mc "Don't worry, we'll figure it out."
# s3_mc "As long as you help me with mine."
# genevieve "Oh, thank you!"
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): I'll help you out too. I bet it won't take long if we work as a team.

# -Best get cracking!
# s3_mc "The clock is ticking..."
# genevieve "Oh, don't!"
# s3_mc "Tick tock, tick tock..."
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): You haven't done yours yet either, have you?
# s3_mc "Well... not exactly."
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): I'll help both of you out. I bet it won't take long if we work as a team.

# -I totally finished mine already
# s3_mc "I've already written mine."
# genevieve "Oh no, I'm so behind!"
# s3_mc "Yeah, I had it done before I was even at the Villa."
# s3_mc "In the taxi, I had a notebook on my lap."
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): Now you're just messing with us.
# s3_mc "Guilty."
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): I'll help both of you out. I bet it won't take long if we work as a team.

# Nicky/Elladine hands out pads of paper and pens.
# Genevieve starts doodling a spiral on the corner of her paper.
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): Focus, you!
# genevieve "I don't know where to start."
# genevieve "I've never done something like this before!"
# Choiceseb "You need to..."
# -Make a joke out of it

# -Say how hot Seb is
# genevieve "He is really hot..."

# -Speak from the heart
# genevieve "Speak from the heart, OK..."

# Genevieve mutters as she scribbles something down.
# genevieve "Alright, enough about me."
# genevieve "What are you planning to say, MC?"
# Choiceseb "“I didn't know if I'd meet the perfect person in the Villa...”"
# -”... and maybe he's/she's lurking in the swimming pool...”
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): That'll give [him_her] a giggle. (you get 😂 with Viv and Nicky/Elladine)
# genevieve "Imagine, though!"
# genevieve "It'd be like at a wedding where they ask if anyone has any objections."

# -”... but [he_she] certainly has the perfect body...”
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): Three words for you. TMI! (you get 😂 with Genevieve)
# genevieve "That's three letters."
# genevieve "And we're on Love Island. TMI's the name of the game."

# -”... but my heart knows I'm in the right couple...”
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): Aww, that's adorable. (you get 🙂 with Nicky/Elladine and Genevieve)
# genevieve "Yeah, you're so lovely together."

# You both carry on scribbling. Genevieve crosses something out, then sighs loudly.
# genevieve "Maybe I should mention his cat...?"
# You look down at your page. So far, the speech is pretty cute.
# thought "I could change it up for the middle."
# Choiceseb "What kind of thing shall I say next? “I'll always remember...”"
# -”... joking around with you...”
# genevieve "It's true, that's so important. (you get 🙂 with Genevieve)"

# -”... your gorgeous bottom...”
# genevieve "Cheeky! (you get 😂 with Genevive)"
# s3_mc "But true."

# -”... our eyes meeting for the first time...”
# genevieve "That's so sweet. (you get 🙂 with Genevieve)"

# N(L+N) / E(R+E): Alright, girls. Focus is still key.
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): The last part of the speech is important. It's what Seb and LI will remember the most.
# You write down a few ideas, trying them on for size.
# Genevieve groans.
# genevieve "That's so hard! MC, what are you going to say that'll stick in LI's mind?"
# Choiceseb "I'll say something like “you help me...”"
# -”... be the best version of myself...”
# Both Nicky/Elladine and Genevieve sigh dreamily.

# -”... have those tingly vibes...”
# genevieve "Are you planning to just jump LI and kiss [him_her] instead of doing a speech?"
# s3_mc "Who knows?"

# -”... scrape out the last dregs from the ketchup bottle...”
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): Really?
# s3_mc "Yeah, like I can rely on LI when I need [him_her]."
# genevieve "That makes sense... yeah, I can see that."

# You cast your eye over the speech. You're confident you'll have something good to read to LI tonight.
# thought "Everyone will love that funny bit at the end."
# Genevieve yawns.
# genevieve "Alright babes, enough homework."
# From outside, you hear splashing and laughter.
# thought "I wonder what's going on out there?"
# thought "I have to find out."

# You stroll out into the bright sunshine.
# While Seb sits next to the pool reading a book, Miki/Iona and Lily(N+L)/Rafi(E+R) are in the water, close to the steps.
# As you approach, Miki/Iona catches your eye and puts a finger to her lips.
# Lily/Rafi points to Sev and mimes a splashing movement.
# Seb doesn't seem to have noticed any of this.
# Choiceseb "Shall I splash Seb?"
# -Let Miki/Iona splash Seb
# thought "I'm staying neutral in all this."
# thought "I'll sit back and watch the show."
# You sit on the edge of the pool and dip your toes in the water.
# MIki/Iona glides as silently as a shark towards Seb, her eyes fixed on him.
# M/iona "And she strikes!"
# She rears up, but before she can do anything, Seb throws his book aside and cannonballs into the water.
# Lily/Rafi and Miki/Iona shriek with laughter.
# seb "I could tell you were up to something."
# seb "You need to work on your sneaking skills."
# Miki/Iona swims around the pool, while Seb shakes water off his book, grumbling under his breath.

# -Warn Seb
# MIki/Iona glides as silently as a shark towards Seb, her eyes fixed on him.
# You sidle over to Seb and whisper to him.
# s3_mc "Someone's on your tail."
# Seb nods briskly, and shoots you a devious look.
# M/iona "And she strikes!"
# She rears up, but before she can do anything, Seb throws his book aside and cannonballs into the water.
# Lily/Rafi and Miki/Iona shriek with laughter.
# seb "MC warned me that you were up to something."
# M/iona "Traitor!"
# s3_mc "I called it like I saw it."
# Miki/Iona swims around the pool, while Seb pushes off the side and floats on his back.

# -Splash Seb
# You catch Miki's/Iona's eye and raise an eyebrow.
# She nods and starts swimming towards Seb, splashing her arms.
# M/iona "She strikes!"
# She splashes close to Seb, but not so close that she catches him. Seb smirks and goes back to his book.
# It's the perfect moment for you to strike.
# You cannonball straight into the water.
# When you surface, Seb is soaked and spluttering.
# You high five Miki/Iona.
# seb "How are you so sneaky?!"
# s3_mc "I was in the right place at the right time."
# Miki/Iona swims around the pool, while Seb shakes water off his book, grumbling under his breath.

# Lily/Rafi pulls herself/himself out of the water and shakes back her/his hair.
# L(L+N) / R(R+E): Hey MC.
# L(L+N) / R(R+E): Want to rehydrate together?
# M/iona "Is it me, or does that sound dodgy?"
# L(L+N) / R(R+E): Not dodgy! I'm just a little dehydrated, you know?
# Choiceseb "Lily/Rafi wants to refill our water bottles together..."
# -Sure, let's go
# s3_mc "We can always do with hydration."
# L(L+N) / R(R+E): Of course!
# L(L+N) / R(R+E): Nice one. (you get 🙂 with Lily/Rafi)

# -Are you trying something on?
# s3_mc "I never know what you're thinking."
# s3_mc "You've always got an agenda."
# L(L+N) / R(R+E): I'm not... that isn't... (you get 🙁 with Lily/Rafi)
# L(L+N) / R(R+E): I promise it's not anything weird. And your water bottle's nearly empty.
# s3_mc "OK. Let's refill."

# -You look like you could use some
# s3_mc "Are your lips a bit chapped?"
# Lily/Rafi touches a finger to her/his lip, and winces.
# L(L+N) / R(R+E): They feel OK, but you never know...
# s3_mc "Better get some water in you before you keel over!"
# s3_mc "You're right!"

# You and Lily/Rafi make your way over to the kitchen, away from the others.
# As you stand by the water cooler, Lily/Rafi glances over at Seb and Miki/Iona and lowers her/his voice.
# L(L+N) / R(R+E): I actually wanted to chat.
# L(L+N) / R(R+E): I know, I'm incredibly subtle, babe, but you probably realised that.
# Choiceseb "Lily/Rafi thinks she's/he's subtle..."
# -You're as subtle as a ninja
# s3_mc "I didn't even notice your agenda. Very clever."
# Lily/Rafi grins as you.
# L(L+N) / R(R+E): That's the nicest thing anyone's said to me all day. (you get 🙂 with Lily)

# -You're subtle like a plank of wood
# s3_mc "I saw right through you."
# s3_mc "It was obvious you had something on your mind."
# L(L+N) / R(R+E): Oh! Well.. OK. Then we're right on track.

# -You're subtle as a snake
# s3_mc "You're like a viper waiting to strike."
# L(L+N) / R(R+E): Oh! Well... OK. (you get 😲 with Lily/Rafi)
# L(L+N) / R(R+E): I'll take that as a compliment?

# There's a moment's quiet while you fill your bottle. Lily/Rafi hesitates, then pushes on.
# (MC recoupled with Rafi/Lily):
# L(L+N) / R(R+E): I wanted to say, I don't want things to be awkward between us.
# L(L+N) / R(R+E): I know you're with Rafi/Lily now, and I hope things are good there.
# L(L+N) / R(R+E): But I can't help feeling about muddying the waters with the whole grafting on Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ/Ciaran/Tai/Yasmin thing.
# L(L+N) / R(R+E): I did really like Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ/Ciaran/Tai/Yasmin. All that grafting wasn't just for fun.
# Lily/Rafi sighs and looks away for a moment, biting her/his lip.
# L(L+N): I'm not used to apologising. Normally I just wait for people to forget about it.
# R(R+E): But I was only thinking about myself. And to be honest I'm used to that working out fine.
# L(L+N): But I'm sorry for complicating things.
# R(R+E): I'm sorry for complicating things.
# (MC sticking with her former partner):
# L(L+N) / R(R+E): I wanted to say, I think you and LI make a good couple.
# L(L+N) / R(R+E): I did really like LI. All that grafting wasn't just for fun.
# L(L+N) / R(R+E): But I didn't realise what a bond you had. So...
# Lily/Rafi sighs and looks away for a moment.
# L(L+N): I'm not used to apologising. Normally I just wait for people to forget about it.
# L(L+N): I'm sorry for not respecting your connection.
# R(R+E): I'm sorry for not respecting that.
# R(R+E): I wasn't thinking clearly.
# Choiceseb "Lily's/Rafi's apologising for grafting so hard on LI..."
# -It worked out OK in the end (MC recoupled with Rafi/Lily)
# s3_mc "It was stressful at the time, but it feels like forever ago now."
# s3_mc "And I'm happy with Rafi/Lily."
# Lily(L+N)/Rafi(R+E) gives you a bright smile.
# L(L+N) / R(R+E): You know what, I'm glad.

# -We're stronger for it (MC sticking with her former partner)
# s3_mc "It was stressful at the time, but it feels like forever ago now."
# s3_mc "And I'm happy with LI."
# Lily(L+N)/Rafi(R+E) gives you a bright smile.
# L(L+N) / R(R+E): You know what, I'm glad.

# -Would you prefer LI over Nicky/Elladine?
# Lily/Rafi bites her/his lip.
# [he_she] doesn't say anything for several minutes.
# L(L+N) / R(R+E): I do like Nicky/Elladine a lot.
# L(L+N) / R(R+E): I wouldn't have picked [him_her] if I didn't.
# L(L+N) / R(R+E): He's/She's being nice about it, obviously. That's what he's/she's like.
# (MC telling Nicky/Elladine “Maybe you guys can get together afterwards” or “I don't know”):
# L(L+N) / R(R+E): We're going to the prom as friends. And he's/she's planning to look up Elladine/Nicky once he's/she's out.
# L(L+N) / R(R+E): But... maybe we can have some good chillout time before the finale.

# -I wish you'd walked 
# s3_mc "We didn't ask for you to come in and stir things up."
# (MC sticking with her former partner):
# s3_mc "The least you could have done was walk, like Rafi/Lily did."
# L(L+N) / R(R+E): Look, I... (you get 🙁 with Lily/Rafi)
# L(L+N) / R(R+E): I've said my piece. If you don't want to accept it, that's your business. I'm not going to grovel.

# L(L+N) / R(R+E): Anyway. If you want to be friends, I'm happy with that.
# L(L+N) / R(R+E): If not, I'll give you your space.
# She holds out a hand for you to shake.
# Choiceseb "Shall I shake Lily's/Rafi's hand?"

# -Shake her/his hand
# You reach out and shake Lily's/Rafi's hand briskly.
# s3_mc "I'd rather things were chill between us."
# L(L+N) / R(R+E): You're a doll, babe. (you get 🙂 with Lily/Rafi)
# seb "Lily/Rafi, come and tell Miki/Iona she needs to listen to some Tess and the Angry Ghosts."
# L(L+N) / R(R+E): Sure!
# As [he_she] goes, [he_she] whispers to you.
# L(L+N) / R(R+E): I have no idea who they are...

# -Give her/him the cold shoulder
# s3_mc "I'd rather spend my time with people I care about, thanks."
# L(L+N) / R(R+E): Of course. I get it.
# [he_she] lifts her/his wrist to consult a watch that isn't there.
# L(L+N) / R(R+E): Would you look at the time!

# While you sip your water, NickyElladine and Genevieve emerge into the sunshine.
# Nicky/Elladine avoids looking at Lily/Rafi.
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): How's it going, MC?
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): Ooh!
# genevieve "I got a text!"
# text "Islanders, it's time for this very select group to get ready, get set, DANCE! Head over to the lawn where all will be revealed! #strictlynoballroom #jazzhands"
# genevieve "This sounds a lot better than writing speeches."
# s3_mc "Let's go!"
# On the lawn, a speaker has been set up. It's booming out dance music.
# Nearby are stacked chairs, a line of brooms, a pile of ribbons, and a stack of towels.
# s3_mc "How did all this get here?"
# Genevieve's phone dings.
# genevieve "Another text!"
# text "Islanders, you need to come up with an impressive flashmob to surprise your partners at prom tonight. #getyourgrooveon #flashdance"
# miki "Ooh, I love a good viral dance video."
# iona "Ooh, I love a good boogie."
# miki "It'll be perfect for prom."
# s3_mc "Let's do this!"
# s3_mc "This is gonna be hard work. But it'll be great!"
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): It should be peppy and jazzy, like we're in a musical.
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): That'll cheer everyone up.
# M/iona "I've always wanted to do a human pyramid. Can we do that?"
# genevieve "Or maybe just something slow and sultry?"
# thought "They'll never agree if someone doesn't get them in line."
# thought "And that someone is me."
# s3_mc "Hey, listen up!"
# Everyone falls silent and looks at you.
# thought "Ah... now I need to decide."
# Choiceseb "What style shall we go for?"
# -Human pyramid
# s3_mc "Not gonna lie, I love the idea of a human pyramid."
# M/iona "Aw, yeah! (you get 🙂 with Miki/Iona)"

# -Twirling like a musical
# s3_mc "I think a musical vibe would be great."
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): I love it! (you get 🙂 with Nicky/Elladine)

# -Slow and sultry
# s3_mc "Let's go for something intense and soulful."
# genevieve "Fantastic! (you get 🙂 with Genevieve)"

# You get to work.
# As the dance beat worms itself into your brain, you step and twirl and figure out your choreography.
# When you take a water break, Nicky/Elladine eyes the chairs thoughtfully.
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): Maybe we could use the chairs. Like, pick them up and do twirls with them?
# genevieve "Or the brooms?"
# M/iona "The ribbons look pretty cool."
# Choiceseb "What prop shall we use to give our dance extra pizazz?"
# -The brooms
# You point decisively.
# s3_mc "I reckon we should go for the brooms."
# You seize a broom and, together with the others, you coordinate synced spins.

# -The ribbons
# You point decisively.
# s3_mc "I reckon we should go for the ribbons."
# You and the others grab ribbons and start coordinating your spins, sending the ribbons streaming through the air.

# -The chairs
# You point decisively.
# s3_mc "I reckon we should go for the chairs."
# You jump onto a chair and lip-sync to the music while the other three dance around you.

# "Look at those dancers go!"
# "I'd give some of our Islanders a perfect 10..."
# genevieve "And turn, and step, and bend..."
# "...while let's just say some of the others put in a good effort."
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): You'll break my toes, Miki/Iona!
# "But it's the thought that counts."
# "And maybe Miki/Iona should switch to trainers."
# s3_mc "This is tiring!"
# M/iona "Wow, Nicky/Elladine, you're really getting into it!"
# Nicky/Elladine leans back in [his_her] chair and does a high kick while pouting at an imaginary audience.
# Nicky/Elladine starts wrapping his ribbon around himself/herself slowly, pouting at an imaginary audience.
# Nicky/Elladine spins [his_her] broom in [his_her] hands, then starts slow-dancing around it, pouting at an imaginary audience.
# When [he_she] sees everyone looking, [he_she] coughs.
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): Too much?
# M/iona "No way, babe. It's lovely to see you looking so happy!"
# genevieve "We need to figure out a finale."
# genevieve "We've done great, but we need a grand finish."
# genevieve "If we did something really sultry at the end, we'd really get our partners' hearts racing."
# thought "We'd ace this challenge for sure if we ended it with something sexy..."
# thought "And LI would love it."
# thought "[he_she] wouldn't be able to keep [his_her] eyes off me..."
# Choiceseb "Shall we go for a sexy finish?"
# -Let's do this thing (gem choice)
# -Nah, we'll keep it chill
# thought "I bet LI would love it if we did something sexy."
# thought "It would make  a real splash."
# Choiceseb "And be an awesome way to cap off the prom..."
# -Bring on the sexy finale! (gem choice)
# -I'm tired out
# s3_mc "I'm finished with dancing for the day."
# s3_mc "Let's chill out for a bit."
# You chill on the beanbags, chatting till the sunshine begins to fade.

# Gem choice:
# s3_mc "That's a geat idea. It'll be fantastic!"
# s3_mc "I reckon we could do a bit of a striptease."
# genevieve "Yes, yes, yes! I love it!"
# M/iona "It'll give it that extra spice."
# s3_mc "We'll be hotter than a sunny afternoon in the Villa."
# You drape yourself over one of the chairs and run your hand seductively over your hair.
# You trail your ribbon slowly across your chest, running your other hand seductively over your hair.
# You lean seductively against the broom and start dancing, running your hand seductively over your hair.
# s3_mc "Everyone join in!"
# The others copy you. At one point Miki/Iona starts laughing and can't stop.
# genevieve "Miki/Iona! Focus!"
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): I like how you're focusing now you're not speechwriting.
# genevieve "This is so much easier!"
# genevieve "Right, MC?"
# Choiceseb "Is this easier than writing the speeches?"
# -I communicate with my body, not words
# s3_mc "Viv's right, the dance is easier."
# s3_mc "Plus this way I can picture LI's face."
# genevieve "You know it. (you get 🙂 with Genevieve)"
# genevieve "Seb's gonna love this."

# -I'd rather write another speech
# s3_mc "Grinding can be a bit of a grind, you know?"
# E(R+E): I feel you, girl.
# N(L+N): I feel you, mate. (you get 🙂 with Nicky/Elladine)
# genevieve "Just picture LI's face when [he_she] sees you."
# genevieve "He'll/She'll love it. And so will Seb."

# -What if we combined the dance and the speech? (“perfect body” and “lurking in the swimming pool” is missing)
# s3_mc "If we put them both together..."
# You start dancing, timing your words with your steps like you're doing performance poetry.
# s3_mc "My heart knows..."
# You flick out your foot.
# s3_mc "...I'm in the right couple!"
# M/iona "Woo!"
# genevieve "How do you even remember that while you're dancing?"
# genevieve "Anyway we can't all do our speeches at once, no one would be able to understand us."
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): Let's get dancing. Picture LI's face when he sees you.

# s3_mc "We do the slow dance bit at the end, right? (choosing “slow and sultry”)"
# s3_mc "We get in position for the jazz hands, right? (choosing “twirl like a musical”)"
# s3_mc "We jump down from the pyramid at the end, right? (choosing “human pyramid”)"
# genevieve "So then..."
# Genevieve wraps a towel around herself.
# When the music reaches a dramatic moment, she throws the towel aside and strikes a pose.
# genevieve "Try it, MC!"
# You wrap a towel around yourself. It may not be your suit, but it'll do for now.
# Choiceseb "How shall I play this...?"
# -Athletically
# In time with the beat of the music, you stamp your feet expertly. 
# M/iona "Go MC!"

# -Jokily
# You whip the towel off yourself and swing it around your head.
# The others clap and cheer.

# -Sexily

# You throw the towel aside with a dramatic movement, and the other Islanders clap and cheer.
# M/iona "Go MC!"

# You take your time perfecting your routines until the sunshine begins to fade.

# M/iona "Wait, wait, before we go!"
# M/iona "How do we know when to start? Who'll give the signal?"
# N(L+N) / E(R+E): Maybe MC?
# Choiceseb "I could start the flashmob!"
# -No way
# -I will
# s3_mc "I'll do it!"
# s3_mc "Watch for my signal."
# s3_mc "When the time's right, you'll know it."

# -I volunteer Genevieve
# genevieve "OK, OK, I'll do it."
# genevieve "It's got to be easier than writing a speech!"

# s3_mc "I can't believe it's almost prom!"
# s3_mc "Let's get going."

# "It's nearly time for MC and the other Islanders' big moment..."
# "And our favourite dance captain is headed to the dressing rooms to get ready."
# "But she'll need to watch where she's going!"
# Liona "Oh! Sorry!"
# "See, I warned you. No one ever listens to me."
# LI starts to move to one side, but you can't tell which way he's/she's going.
# Choiceseb "Shall I step left or right?"
# -Step left
# You shuffle to the left, and LI steps the same way.
# You do a shuffling dance back and forth, trying to figure out how to pass each other.

# -Deliberately block [his_her] way
# You stretch out your arms and hop from side to side like you're blocking [him_her] in a basketball game.
# s3_mc "She blocks, she scores!"

# -Step right
# You shuffle to the right, and LI steps the same way.
# You do a shuffling dance back and forth, trying to figure out how to pass each other.

# LI snorts a laugh, but still looks a bit embarrassed.
# Liona "You'd think I'd have figured out how to walk by now."
# There's a quick pause as LI looks you up and down.
# Liona "You look so good right now."
# Liona "I can't imagine how you'll look later tonight."
# Liona "I think I might melt."
# LI. I can't wait to see you all dressed up tonight. I think I might melt.
# thought "Since we happen to be here together, we could make the most of it."
# Choiceseb "Shall we have a little quality moment?"
# -Step aside
# You step sideways, bow with a flourish, and allow LI past you.
# Liona "Very chivalrous. I like it!"
# As [he_she] passes close by, you spot a crumpled piece of paper almost hidden in [his_her] hand.

# -Hug LI
# You catch LI in a tight hug. [he_she] sighs and leans close against you, warm and comfortable. (you get 😍 with LI)
# Liona "I can never get enough of that."
# As you draw back, you spot a crumpled piece of paper almost hidden in [his_her] hand.

# -Kiss LI
# You give LI a smouldering look.
# s3_mc "Are you thinking what I'm thinking?"
# LI leans close to kiss you deeply, then murmurs softly against your ear, sending shivers down your neck. (you get 😍 with LI)
# Liona "I'm always thinking about this."
# Liona "Wait, this was what you were thinking, right?"
# Liona "Not, like, dogs or something."
# s3_mc "Don't worry, you weren't barking up the wrong tree."
# As you draw back, you spot a crumpled piece of paper almost hidden in [his_her] hand.

# [he_she] catches you looking, and looks shifty.
# Liona "That's private property. No peeking allowed."
# B/H/yasmin "Rules of the Villa."
# s3_mc "Suck a stickler..."
# C/T/Cam/AJ/R/L: I don't make the rules.
# s3_mc "You never follow the rules anyway..."
# Choiceseb "I could sneak a peek at LI's note..."
# -Let it go
# You smile at LI.
# s3_mc "Don't worry about it. I don't want to pressure you."
# Liona "Aw, you're so sweet."
# Liona "It'll be more fun as a surprise."

# -Trick [him_her] into letting you look
# You put on a puppy-eyed face.
# s3_mc "Oh well... that's OK."
# s3_mc "I didn't really want to know anyway."
# Liona "Oh, I don't want to stress you out."
# As LI reaches to pat you on the shoulder, you whip around and grab the piece of paper.
# Liona "Hey!"
# Just before LI snatches the paper back, you catch sight of your name at the top.
# [he_she] tucks the note carefully into [his_her] shorts.

# -Ask straight out
# You put your most innocent expression.
# s3_mc "I'm not trying to get you into trouble..."
# s3_mc "But I'd love to know what it is."
# LI laughs.
# Liona "I can't resist that face. And that voice. And that everything."
# Liona "Here."
# [he_she] waves the paper in front of your face, and you catch the sight of your name at the top.
# [he_she] tucks the note carefully into [his_her] shorts.

# Liona "It's my speech for tonight."
# B/H/Cam/AJ/R/L: I don't normally worry about speaking my mind, but this feels different.
# C/T/yasmin "I don't normally get bothered about this kind of thing, but it's nerve-wracking."
# Choiceseb "LI feels nervous about [his_her] speech tonight..."
# -Best get practising!
# s3_mc "What are you waiting for?"
# s3_mc "Get cracking! It needs to be perfect!"
# LI looks alarmed for a second, then taps you lightly on the forehead.
# Liona "I was... and then I got distracted."
# Liona "By someone very special."

# -Just imagine everyone naked (Rafi,Lily missing)
# s3_mc "You know what they say..."
# s3_mc "Picture everyone naked."
# "Everyone?"
# Liona "Everyone?"
# s3_mc "Sure, why not?"
# C/T/Cam/aj "Sounds like a party."
# B/H/yasmin "Woah."

# -You'll smash it

# Liona "Anyway, I should go and get dressed."

# thought "I can't be late for prom!"

# "Crack on, Cinderella, you don't want to turn into a pumpkin!"
# "Next up..."

# genevieve "I think that kiss speaks for itself."
# (MC gave her advice “speak from the heart”):

# Liona "Looking forward to your bed when you get back."
# s3_mc "Exactly."

# LI steps out to the hot tub. You follow [him_her] outside.
# Steam is already rising from the hot tub. (MC and LI are wearing their swimwear)

# Choiceseb "Make out in the hot tub?"
# -Nah, let's just have a chat in the water (no further reactions; jumps to “LI looks up at the stars”)

# -Heck yes
# LI smiles.
# You get into the water and pull LI closer to you. (you get 😍 with LI)

# Liona "I could never get tired of kissing you."
# Liona "You're perfect."

# Choiceseb "LI wants to have a deep chat."
# -Admire the stars (Yasmin is missing)
# s3_mc "The stars are looking lovely tonight."
# Liona "Yeah, they really are."
# R: I always think it's weird how famous people are compared to stars.
# R: We're not burning balls of rock, you know?
# s3_mc "Yeah."
# s3_mc "I guess it's kind of odd."
# camilo "When we were younger me and my brother used to come outside and try to count all the stars we could see."

# Liona "But aside from that I'm just really hyped to see where things go with you and me."

# [he_she] stretches out [his_her] arms and puts one around your shoulder.
# Liona "It's crazy how much your feelings can get so strong over such a short period of time, isn't it?"
# s3_mc "Maybe it's because we're sharing a bed with each other all the time and stuff."
# Liona "Yeah, maybe!"
# Choiceseb "Speaking of bed..."
# -Let's go to sleep now in bed

# -Let's go and do bits in the bed

# [he_she] slowly strokes your thigh.
# Your muscles quiver under [his_her] touch.

# -Try something new (Lily missing)
# s3_mc "I want to try doing this with you..."
# You whisper in LI's ear.
# Yasmin nods knowingly, her eyes daring you.
# yasmin "I've been wanting to do that for a long time."
# B/C/AJ/R: Woah!
# s3_mc "You OK? We don't have to if you don't want to."
# Bill/Ciaran/AJ/Rafi looks surprised but intrigued.
# B/C/AJ/R: no, I want to. I've just never done that before.

# LI struggles to catch [his_her] breath.
# Liona "That was amazing."

# Liona "I feel so, like, content, you know?"
# (MC and LI are wearing their sleepwear)
# C/T/aj "Bagsy being the little spoon."
# B/H/Cam/Y/AJ/R/L: I don't think I could ever get bored cuddling you, MC.
# B/H/Y/R: You know, before you I never really was someone who liked to spoon but now you've totally spoonified me.

# Liona "Sure, MC. That totally sounds like something you'd do."
# Liona "What would you do with the money?"

# LI puts [his_her] hands on your hips and gently tugs your waist towards [his_her] body.
# Liona "Prove it."
# You smile, pressing your lips against LI's.
# [he_she] sighs contentedly, kissing you back delicately.
# You stroke the back of [his_her] neck, feeling him shiver under your touch.

# You wipe your eyes emotionally.

# -Make out against the wall
# s3_mc "That's strange..."
# You hold LI's gaze as you step closer, a tantalising grin on your lips.
# You lean in until your lips are hovering just above [his_her] ears and whisper...
# s3_mc "I happen to feel exactly the same."
# LI puts [his_her] hands on your hips and gently tugs your waist towards [his_her] body.
# Liona "Prove it."
# LI's eyes grow wide as you walk [him_her] slowly back into the wall.
# You kiss [him_her] passionately, pressing [him_her] up against the wall, running your hands along [his_her] broad shoulders and strong chest.
# Liona "MC..."
# [he_she] breathes your name as you kiss [his_her] neck, lightly, teasingly.
# When you bring your lips to LI's again, [he_she] wraps [his_her] arms around your neck and pulls you as close as it's possible to be.
# You both are left breathless and panting.
# Liona "OK... to be continued later."
# s3_mc "Definitely."
# Liona "But the others are probably waiting for us now."
# s3_mc "Yea. I know how much they love their breakfast."

# s3_mc "OK, let's get some breakfast."

# You walk into the kitchen, holding LI's hand.
# s3_mc "Hey everyone!"
# The others are busy making pancakes, but when they see you, they all stop doing what they're doing and start clapping.
# Nicky even cheers.
# Elladine even whoops.

# M/iona "You were gone for so long... It's so good to see you!"

# genevieve "The shiny demon is a strict pescatarian, I'll have you know."
# s3_mc "We aren't that late..."
# B/H/camilo "It's called Seven Minutes in Heaven, not Seven Hours. (not choosing the gem option for the hideaway)(depending on who MC's coupled with and who was dumped out of these three)"
# (choosing the gem option for the hideaway):
# seb "Mate, we were about to start an expedition to the hideaway."
# seb "Maybe you got sucked into one of the hot tub jets, or something."
# H/Cam/bill "That happens. I've seen it. (always Harry except if MC's coupled with him or Harry was dumped)"
# (MC coupled with Camilo/Bill and didn't taught Harry breakfast on day 3 part 1):

# Liona "You're terrible."

# -Squeeze back
# You grip [his_her] hand tightly and [he_she] smiles at you.
# Liona "The hard part's over. We made it, babe. (you get 😍 with LI)"
# Liona "Let's just enjoy the moment."

# Liona "So... what happens now?"
# Choiceseb "Now, we..."
# -Wait for someone to tell us what to do
# AJ/ciaran "I hope someone turns up soon..."
# AJ/ciaran "All these eyes on us are making me nervous!"
# B/H/Cam/T/Y/R/L: Really? We just have to wait?
# B/H/Cam/T/Y/R/L: I really feel like we should be doing something...

# -Fight each other in the arena
# B/H/Cam/AJ/C/T/R: You're on. I'll take the sword and shield; you get the trident and net.
# B/H/Cam/AJ/C/T/R: There can only be one winner.
# L/yasmin "I don't think I could fight you."
# L/yasmin "I'd just lie down and let you win."
# s3_mc "Where's the fun in that?"

# -Run back and barricade ourselves inside the Villa (Lily is missing)
# B/H/AJ/R: I'll grab the wood and nails, you gather supplies.
# B/H/AJ/R: The real world can wait.
# C/T/Y/camilo "And disappoint all our adoring fans?"
# C/T/Y/camilo "Not to mention our families!"

# A woman suddenly runs up to you, busting with joy.
# Look who's back!
# Chelsea

# Chelsea: Congratulations, you guys!
# She flings her arms around you both and hugs you like you've been her best friend for years.
# Chelsea: I've been watching you absolutely crush it in there, girl!
# Chelsea: I'd have thrown a tantrum if you didn't win!
# LI whispers to you.
# Liona "I don't know who this is..."
# Choiceseb "She's so friendly..."
# -Wow, I can't believe it's you!
# Chelsea: I can't believe I'm back here, either!
# Chelsea: Apparently loads of people wrote in asking to see me on telly again, so here I am!

# -Er, who are you?
# She claps her hand over her mouth and pretends to be shocked.
# Chelsea: Someone didn't watch the last season!
# Chelsea: I'm Chelsea. Nice to meet you!

# -I was hoping for Priya
# Chelsea: Priya is fabulous!
# Chelsea: But I'm afraid you're stuck with me.

# Chelsea: I'm the host for this evening!
# Chelsea: Come this way, lovelies.
# Chelsea leads you over to a big screen projected onto the wall of the Villa.
# Chelsea: So here we are, guys.
# Chelsea: I'll ask you first, MC. How would you describe your time in the Villa?
# Choiceseb "How would I describe my time in the Villa?"
# -So chilled and relaxing
# s3_mc "I was expecting non-stop drama, you know?"
# s3_mc "There were ups and downs but mostly it felt like I was just on holiday with all my best friends."
# Chelsea: Quite different to previous years, then!
# Chelsea: Would you say that was down to LI?
# Choiceseb "Was the Villa relaxing because of LI?"
# -Absolutely
# LI smiles.
# s3_mc "I feel so safe and comfortable with [him_her]."
# s3_mc "He's/She's been my rock in here."
# s3_mc "For basically the whole time. (Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ)"
# s3_mc "It took us a little while, but we made it. (with Ciaran/Tai/Yasmin)"
# s3_mc "[he_she] kinda swooped in at the last minute and changed everything. (Rafi/Lily)"
# Chelsea: That's wonderful.

# -Actually, [he_she] was the only exciting thing
# Chelsea: I see! So [he_she] spiced it up a bit, then?
# s3_mc "Definitely."
# s3_mc "It was a really nice balance."

# -Actually, it was due to BFF
# Chelsea: Ah yeah, your friendship with BFF was one of the reasons we all fell in love with you!
# Chelsea: But we'll get on to that a bit later.

# -The most amazing, experience of my life
# s3_mc "It was great."
# s3_mc "Better than I could have ever hoped."
# Chelsea: We were all pretty jealous of how much fun you were having.
# Chelsea: What would you say was the biggest reason it was so good?
# Choiceseb "What made this experience so good?"
# -The Villa

# -LI
# LI grins at you. (you get 😍 with LI)
# s3_mc "[he_she] really made my time here special."
# s3_mc "[he_she] was my rock. For basically the whole time. ( Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ)"
# s3_mc "It took us a little while, but we made it. (Ciaran/Tai/Yasmin)"
# s3_mc "[he_she] kinda swooped in at the last minute and changed everything. (Rafi/Lily)"

# -BFF
# Chelsea: Ah yeah, your friendship with BFF was one of the reasons we all fell in love with you!
# Chelsea: But we'll get on to that a bit later.

# -A total blur
# s3_mc "To be honest, Chelsea, it went by in a flash."
# s3_mc "I wish I'd had more time!"
# Chelsea: Does that mean you wanted more time with LI?
# Choiceseb "Do I wish I'd had more time with LI?"
# -I wish I'd got to know other people too
# -I wish I'd had more time with BFF
# Chelsea: Ah yeah, your friendship with BFF was one of the reasons we all fell in love with you!
# Chelsea: But we'll get to that in a bit later.

# -Yes
# LI smiles. (you get 😍 with LI)
# Chelsea: Well now you've got the rest of your lives to get to know each other, if you like!
# s3_mc "I can't wait."
# Liona "Me neither."

# Chelsea: Let's talk to you LI.
# Chelsea: How do you feel, sitting with LI after winning Love Island?
# Chelsea: Did you see yourself ending up here?
# B/H/Cam/aj "From the moment we met, there was no doubt in my mind that MC was the one for me."
# C/T/yasmin "MC had always caught my eye, and as soon as we coupled up, I knew it was real."
# R/L: I'd had my eye on MC the whole time, so when I went into the Villa, I knew what my goal was.
# R/L: And I always achieve my goals.
# (MC coupled with Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ/Ciaran/Tai/Yasmin):
# Liona "And here we are."
# [he_she] squeezes your hand.
# The screen behind you flickers into life.
# Chelsea: It's been quite a ride for both of you. Let's take a look at some of your best moments.

# Background is the bedroom:
# Chelsea: It didn't take long for you to make an impression, MC. 
# aj "Man, I knew everyone here was gonna be gorgeous, but I wasn't prepared..."
# elladine "Stop staring!"
# Background is the lawn:
# Chelsea: And right away you chose to couple up with Bill/Harry/Camilo.
# s3_mc "The boy I want to couple up with is... Bill/Harry/Camilo."
# B/H/camilo "Nice one."
# Background is the stage again:
# (if MC ended with her Day 1 partner):
# Chelsea: It was obvious right away that you two were endgame... 
# Chelsea: Hashtag goals, right?
# Chelsea: But it wasn't plain sailing, was it babes?
# (if MC didn't end with her Day 1 partner):
# Chelsea: Now, we know that didn't work out in the end, babe.
# Chelsea: The first step on your path was a bumpy one!
# Chelsea: Let's talk about Miki/Genevieve/Iona, shall we?
# Background is the firepit:
# M/G/iona "The boy I'd like to couple up with is..."
# M/G/iona "Bill/Harry/Camilo."
# Background is the stage again:
# The crowd boos.
# Chelsea: Hey, stoppit! We love Miki/Genevieve/Iona really.
# (Genevieve as BFF and MC coupled with Harry on day 1):
# Chelsea: You and her ended up being really good friends.
# Chelsea: Everyone was so impressed with your maturity.
# Chelsea: A lot of girls would have been like, right, I'm done with her now.
# Choiceseb "I ended up best friends with Genevieve though she stole Harry..."
# -Me and Harry were meant to be (MC ended with Harry)
# -I didn't blame her
# s3_mc "Not even for a second."
# s3_mc "She was put in a really difficult situation, and in some ways I'm glad that it was my man she coupled up with."
# s3_mc "We might not have ended up as such good friends otherwise."
# Chelsea: That's beautiful.

# -Me and Harry weren't meant to be anyway (MC didn't end with Harry)
# Chelsea: Obviously not!
# s3_mc "Me and Harry had known each other for five minutes. I wasn't about to stress."
# Chelsea: And as it turns out, Genevieve and Harry weren't meant to be either.

# -She and Seb were meant to be, anyway
# s3_mc "It's funny how things work out sometimes."
# Chelsea: You're too right, girl.

# (next scene doesn't appear if MC coupled with Harry on day 1 and Genevieve is BFF):
# (if you couldn't forgive Miki/Iona/Genevieve for taking Bill/Harry/Camilo):
# Chelsea: It was tough for you to forgive her for that, right?
# Chelsea: And as you can see, everyone else was on your side as well.
# Chelsea: But I wanna know, babe...
# Chelsea: How do you feel about it now?
# Choiceseb "How do I feel about Miki/Genevieve/Iona taking Bill/Harry/Camilo?"
# -I've forgiven her now
# -She's fine, but we're not friends
# -She probably did me a favour (MC not ending with Bill/Harry/Camilo)
# s3_mc "It was alright in the end. It's not like Bill/Harry/Camilo and I were destined for each other."
# Chelsea: That's so wise, girl.
# Chelsea: You totally forgave her for taking Bill/Harry/Camilo. What was going through your mind when you did that?
# Choiceseb "Why did I forgive Miki/Genevieve/Iona?"
# -She had a difficult choice
# s3_mc "There was no right answer, really."
# s3_mc "I felt sorry for her more than anything."

# -I respect her guts
# s3_mc "Credit where credit's due."
# s3_mc "She had a job to do and she just got on and did it."
# s3_mc "She and I are pretty similar that way."

# -Me and Bill/Harry/Camilo were meant to be (MC ended with Bill/Harry/Camilo)
# s3_mc "This is fate. There was nothing Miki/Genevieve/Iona could have done to get in the way."
# Chelsea: Well said, girl!

# -Me and Bill/Harry/Camilo weren't meant to be anyway (MC didn't end with Bill/Harry/Camilo)
# s3_mc "It was alright in the end, it's not like Bill/Harry/Camilo and I were destined for each other."
# Chelsea: That's so wise, girl.

# Chelsea: One of the things that really helped you get through that nasty little surprise was your friendship with BFF.
# Background is the roof terrace:
# bff "So, how are you doing?"
# bff "Tonight must have been tough..."
# Background is the stage again:
# Chelsea: Oh em gee, we loved you guys!
# Chelsea: You were like sisters! (BFF is Elladine/Genevieve)
# Chelsea: You were like brother and sister! (BFF with Seb/Nicky)
# (Seb/Nicky as BFF and Genevieve/Elladine as BFF if MC is bisexual):
# Chelsea: Can I ask you an honest question, LI?
# Liona "Sure thing."
# Chelsea: Were you ever threatened by MC's friendship with Seb/Nicky?
# Chelsea: They were, like, super close. And this is Love Island, after all.
# thought "I'm interested to hear this..."
# Liona "You know what? No."
# LI hugs your shoulders.
# Liona "People love to say 'it's not Friend Island', but the thing is, it's not Sex Island either."
# Liona "There's all different kinds of love, and I'm just really glad that MC and Seb/Nicky found each other."
# Chelsea: What a great answer.
# Chelsea: Round of applause for LI!
# The crowd cheers and claps.
# Chelsea: MC, is there anything you want to shout out to BFF right now?
# Choiceseb "What do I want to say to BFF? (no further reactions)"
# -I love ya, babe!
# Chelsea: Don't we all!

# -See you soon!
# Chelsea: I can't wait to see you guys reunited!

# -You'd better name one of them after me now! (Seb as BFF)
# Chelsea: Aw, you guys!

# -I'll always be your Bathroom Babe! (Genevieve is BFF)
# Chelsea: Aw, you guys!

# -Remember, you're always good enough (Elladine is BFF)
# Chelsea: Aw, you guys!

# -Tell your sister that your Villa sister says hi! (Nicky as BFF)
# Chelsea: Aw, you guys!

# Chelsea: Then there was the recoupling on day three.
# Chelsea: Let's see how that went.
# Background is the firepit:
# s3_mc "The Islander I want to couple up with is..."
# s3_mc "Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ."
# Background is the stage again:
# Chelsea: You were totally like 'No, Miki/Genevieve/Iona! He's mine!' (MC coupled with the same person as on day 1)
# Chelsea: You were totally like 'I'm moving on, see ya!” (MC coupled with a different person as on day 1)
# Chelsea: And when you moved on, you really moved on. But we'll get to that in a bit, babes. (picking AJ on day 3)
# (MC coupled with Bill/Camilo/Harry on day 3 and ended with the them):
# Chelsea: Which turned out to be a very good decision. 
# B/H/camilo "I'd say so, yeah."
# (MC didn't end with the person coupled on day 3):
# Chelsea: Which didn't work out in the end, but we'll get to that in a bit, babes.

# (not choosing the diamond choice from day 3 episode 3)
# Chelsea: At this point, everyone was pretty much all-in on you two.
# Chelsea: But it wasn't in the stars, babe.(MC didn't end with the person coupled on day 3)
# (diamond choice from day 3 episode 3):
# Chelsea: After the recoupling, you and Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ shared a nice moment on the roof.
# (doing bits on the roof terrace):
# Chelsea: A very nice moment.
# Choiceseb "I had sex with Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ on the roof..."
# -How embarrassing
# You blush and try to hide your face with your hands.
# Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ/Tai/Ciaran/Yasmin/Rafi/Lily laughs and puts [his_her] arms around you.
# [he_she] kisses the top of your head.

# -Just another notch for my bedpost
# You grin and wink at the audience.
# Ciaran/Tai/Yasmin/Lily/Rafi laughs.
# C/T/Y/L/R: You don't need to downplay it, babe.
# You shrug.
# s3_mc "It honestly didn't mean anything."
# B/H/Cam/aj "Maybe we can notch it up some more later."

# -It was wonderful
# You smile and close your eyes, remembering.
# Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ squeezes your hand.
# B/H/Cam/aj "It really was."
# Tai/Ciaran/Yasmin/Rafi/Lily laughs a little awkward but squeezes your shoulders.

# Background is the lawn:
# Chelsea: Day Four was a bit in-tents.
# aj "I can't find the hole! (MC coupled with AJ)"
# B/H/camilo "This rod's really stiff. (MC coupled with Bill/Harry/Camilo)"
# Background is the stage again:
# (if you didn't win the challenge):
# Choiceseb "Oh geez...(Bill,Harry,Camilo,AJ missing)"
# -I'm never going camping again
# Chelsea: I can't say I blame you, babes.
# T/C/Y/RL: Hey, now you've got me. We'll definitely smash any future tent-erecting contests.

# -We were robbed (Bill,Harry,Camilo,AJ missing)
# T/C/Y/R/L: Were you, though?
# s3_mc "It was a fix."

# -I blame it on Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ (Bill,Harry,Camilo,AJ missing)
# (MC didn't end with the person coupled on day 3):
# T/C/Y/R/L: Hey, it wasn't just Bill's/Harry's/Camilo's/AJ's fault!
# T/C/Y/R/L: From where I was sitting, it looked like a joint effort.
# Chelsea: Is effort really the right word?

# (if you won the challenge):
# Choiceseb "We smashed that tent challenge..."
# -Thanks to Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ (didn't pick the gem choice from day 4 part 2)

# -Because of my skills
# (MC ended with the person coupled on day 3):
# B/H/Cam/aj "I helped too!"
# s3_mc "Yeah, babe, but let's be real about who carried the team."
# B/H/Cam/aj "I'll let you have this one."
# (MC didn't end with the person coupled on day 3):
# Chelsea: Totally. Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ would have been lost without you.
# s3_mc "Absolutely."

# -Thanks to the decorations (gem choice from day 4 part 2)
# B/H/Cam/aj "It looked so sweet!"
# C/T/Y/R/L: Do you think you'd do the same for me?
# s3_mc "I might consider it."

# -Through teamwork
# (MC ended with the person coupled on day 3):
# You high five.
# B/H/Cam/aj "Totally."
# (MC didn't end with the person coupled on day 3):
# C/T/Y/R/L: Imagine how great your tent would be now you're with me.

# Chelsea: And then things really got shaken up. (MC ended with Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ/Rafi/Lily)
# Chelsea: And then along came fate. (MC ended with Ciaran/Tai/Yasmin)
# Chelsea: The new Islanders really brought a fresh energy to the Villa, didn't they?
# Chelsea: Pottery must do it for you, MC... (didn't pick gem choice from day 5 part 1)
# Chelsea: Badges must do it for you, MC... (didn't pick gem choice from day 5 part 1)
# Chelsea: Dogs must do it for you, MC... (didn't pick gem choice from day 5 part 1)
# Chelsea: And you managed to get a leg up on the competition by having a root through their bags. (gem choice from day 5 part 1)
# s3_mc "They said I could! (gem choice from day 5 part 1)"
# Chelsea: Then you got to go on dates with our lovely newcomers.
# (gem choice from day 5 part 2; waterfall with Tai):
# Chelsea: The less said about what you got up behind the waterfall the better, babes. 
# You and Tai grin and high five.
# Chelsea: How did you feel about that, Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ/Ciaran/Yasmin/Rafi/Lily?
# Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ/Ciaran/Yasmin/Rafi/Lily shrugs.
# B/H/Cam/AJ/C/Y/R/L: More power to them, I guess.
# Chelsea: Let's see what happened after that.
# Background is the firepit:
# ciaran "Like, my love life up to now has been fine, but it's just been fine. It's not been exciting, it's not been special."
# ciaran "Well, this girl is both exciting and special for sure."
# tai "Well, this girl has got great banter, which is the number one thing I look for..."
# tai "And she's proper fit, too, which doesn't hurt."
# yasmin "Well, I came to Love Island looking for that special feeling."
# yasmin "When you meet someone for the first time and you just know, somehow, you'll never be the same again."
# C/T/yasmin "Which is why the girl I want to couple up with is..."
# C/T/yasmin "MC."
# Background is the stage again:
# Chelsea: So what went through your mind when Ciaran/Tai/Yasmin picked you?
# Choiceseb "What was I thinking when Ciaran/Tai/Yasmin picked me?"
# -I was over the moon
# s3_mc "For obvious reasons. (MC ended with Ciaran/Tai/Yasmin after being picked)"
# (MC didn't end with Ciaran/Tai/Yasmin after being picked):
# s3_mc "I knew I needed a change."
# s3_mc "But Ciaran/Tai/Yasmin wasn't quite who I was looking for."
# s3_mc "Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ/Ciaran/Tai/Yasmin/Rafi/Lily was. (whoever MC ended with)"
# Chelsea: Well you found your way to [him_her] eventually!

# -I was interested to try something new
# (MC ended with Ciaran/Tai/Yasmin after being picked):
# s3_mc "Turns out, something new was exactly what I needed."
# (MC didn't end with Ciaran/Tai/Yasmin after being picked):
# s3_mc "Playing the field obviously worked for me, even if Ciaran/Tai/Yasmin wasn't the one."

# -I was annoyed
# (MC ended with her partner from day 3):
# s3_mc "Anyone would be!"
# s3_mc "Snatched away from my Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ..."
# B/H/Cam/aj "But we found our way back to each other, though."
# (MC didn't end with her partner from day 3):
# s3_mc "I really thought Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ was the one."
# s3_mc "I was wrong, for the record."
# C/T/Y/R/L: So wrong.

# Background is the lawn:
# Chelsea: Then on day seven, things definitely got heated around the BBQ.
# tai "You've got to have a good girthy flame otherwise it won't cook."
# bill "Girthy flames are not a thing."
# tai "You wouldn't know."
# Background is the stage again:
# Choiceseb "Tai and Bill's argument about burgers was..."
# -Exasperating
# Chelsea: Tell me about it, girl!

# -So pointless I'd forgotten about it
# Chelsea: It was a little silly.
# B/tai "Hmph.(MC ended with Bill/Tai):"
# B/tai "The burgers got cooked in the end, didn't they?(MC ended with Bill/Tai):"

# -Kind of sexy
# s3_mc "Passion is sexy."
# Chelsea points to Bill/Tai.(MC ended with Bill/Tai):
# Chelsea: Obviously!(MC ended with Bill/Tai):

# Chelsea: We also sadly said goodbye to Camilo/Bill and Iona/Miki.
# Chelsea: You voted for them. How do you feel when they left?
# Choiceseb "How did I feel when Camilo/Bill and Iona/Miki were dumped from the Villa?"
# -Really happy
# -I didn't feel anything (no further reactions)
# Chelsea: Really?
# Choiceseb "Yeah, I..."
# -Was just glad Bill/Camilo didn't go
# -Never really got on with Miki/Iona
# -Have no emotions
# Chelsea: I see...

# -Absolutely gutted
# Choiceseb "I really liked... (no further reactions)"
# -Camilo/Bill
# -Iona/Miki
# -Them both
# Chelsea: So did we, babes.

# Background is the firepit:
# s3_mc "So the person I want to couple up with is..."
# s3_mc "Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ/Ciaran/Tai/Yasmin."
# Background is the stage again:
# Chelsea: What was going through your mind when you picked Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ/ Ciaran/Tai/Yasmin, thinking it would be the last recoupling?
# Choiceseb "What was I thinking when I picked Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ/Ciaran/Tai/ Yasmin?"
# -I still didn't feel quite right (only appears if MC ended with Rafi/Lily)
# -I was interested to see where things went
# Chelsea: Things went pretty well, I think it's safe to say! (MC ended with her partner from day 9)
# Chelsea: Turns out there was at least one more surprise right around the corner... (MC ended with Rafi/Lily)

# -I wanted to pick up where we left off (only appears if MC picked her partner from day 3)
# s3_mc "I hated the feeling like we had left something unfinished."
# Chelsea: Looks like that was a good choice, babe! (MC ended with her partner from day 3)
# Chelsea: Turns out there was at least one more surprise right around the corner... (MC ended with Rafi/Lily)

# -I was totally smitten
# Chelsea: So were we, babe. Everyone was just like 'yasss!' when you picked [him_her].

# -I wanted to try something new (only appears if MC didn't pick her partner from day 3 or day 6)
# Chelsea: Turns out you didn't know what you were waiting for. (Rafi/Lily)
# Chelsea: Turns out that was a good decision. (MC ended with her partner from day 9)

# Chelsea: So you thought that would be the final recoupling...
# Chelsea: But Rafi and Lily were plopped into the Villa like a couple of strawberries into a glass of bubbly.
# Chelsea: What went through your mind when you first saw Rafi/Lily? (depending who grafted MC)
# Choiceseb "Honestly?"
# -I was blown away
# (MC ended with Rafi/Lily):
# Rafi/Lily grins at you.
# s3_mc "Alright, don't get too full of yourself."
# s3_mc "We all know you're a beautiful human being."
# (MC ended with Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ/Ciaran/Tai/Yasmin):
# LI shifts uncomfortably in [his_her] seat.
# s3_mc "Oh, c'mon. You had nothing to worry about."
# Liona "I know."

# -I was like 'finally!' (Bill,Harry,Camilo,AJ,Ciaran,Tai,Yasmin missing)
# s3_mc "It was like a breath of fresh air, Chelsea."
# (MC ended with Rafi/Lily):
# Chelsea: So is it safe to say that [he_she] changed everything for you?
# s3_mc "Absolutely."

# -I wasn't that impressed
# (MC ended with Rafi/Lily):
# Rafi/Lily chuckles.
# s3_mc "But then I got to know [him_her]. And, well..."
# s3_mc "You know the rest."
# (MC ended with Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ/Ciaran/Tai/Yasmin):
# s3_mc "Nice to look at, but I knew I had something special with Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ/ Ciaran/Tai/Yasmin."

# Background is the living room:
# The screen shows you lurking and eavesdropping on Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ/Ciaran/ Tai/Yasmin and Lily/Rafi.
# Besides you on the couch, Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ/Ciaran/Tai/Yasmin gaps.(MC ended with Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ/Ciaran/Tai/Yasmin)
# L/R: You're my hero.
# The screen shows you barging in to interrupt Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ/Ciaran/Tai/Yasmin and Lily/Rafi.
# B/H/Cam/AJ/C/T/yasmin "Oh! I thought you were getting ready."
# The screen shows you leaving quietly, but the camera remains focused on Bill/ Harry/Camilo/AJ/Ciaran/Tai/Yasmin and Lily/Rafi.
# L/R: You're my hero.
# Your heart starts to beat quicker.
# Liona "Aww, it's fine. I wanted to help out."
# L/R: I mean it. You're so thoughtful and kind...
# L/R: You and MC make a really sweet couple.
# You breathe a sigh of relief.
# Background is the stage again:
# Chelsea: That was a big moment. I was on the edge of my seat!
# Chelsea: Did you ever see her as a threat to you and Bill's/Harry's/Camilo's/AJ's/ Tai's/Ciaran's/Yasmin's relationship?
# Choiceseb "Did I ever see Lily/Rafi as a threat?"
# -Not even for a second
# (MC ended with Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ/Ciaran/Tai/Yasmin):
# s3_mc "I knew there was no way LI would pie me."
# Liona "Absolutely not."
# LI squeezes your hand.

# (MC ended with Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ/Ciaran/Tai/Yasmin):
# B/H/Cam/AJ/C/T/yasmin "What, really? Don't you trust me?"
# (if you made peace with Lily/Rafi):

# (MC ended with Rafi/Lily):

# C/aj "But now I know I didn't have anything to worry about."
# Chelsea: And you were totally right about that, babe.
# Chelsea: After that recoupling, we of course said goodbye to Yasmin, Ciaran, AJ and Tai/Harry. (Depending on who was dumped)
# Chelsea: And we were very sad to see them go. Weren't we?
# The crowd murmurs in sympathy.
# (gem choice from day 11):
# Chelsea: Especially AJ/Yasmin/Ciaran/Tai/Harry. When you helped her/him pack... 
# She sniffs.
# (if you chose to kiss them when helping them pack):
# The screen shows you and AJ/Yasmin/Ciaran/Tai/Harry kissing. 
# Chelsea: That kiss!
# LI shifts a little in [his_her] seat. You glance at [him_her] nervously, but [he_she] smiles faintly at you.
# Liona "It's OK. I know you had history."
# Chelsea: Such a beautiful moment.
# Chelsea: But there was one person everyone was especially heartbroken to see go.
# Someone in the crowd shouts 'Elladine/Nicky!' and Chelsea nods sadly.
# Chelsea: That's right.
# (Elladine/Nicky as BFF and they left the Villa):
# Chelsea: How did it feel, having your best friend leave like that?
# Choiceseb "How did it feel when Elladine/Nicky left?"
# -It felt so great... Not!
# -It felt OK. I'll see her/him again on the outside
# -It felt terrible, Chelsea
# s3_mc "Obviously."
# Chelsea: Yeah, I'm sorry hun. But you'll see her again soon, right?
# s3_mc "Maybe."
# Chelsea: Nicky and Elladine were a great couple. (Elladine/Nicky not BFF, or is BFF but didn't walk)
# Chelsea: And Nicky/Elladine was your Villa bestie. (Nicky/Elladine is BFF and didn't walk)
# (If you told Nicky/Elladine to give it a go with Lily/Rafi):
# Chelsea: But I have to ask...
# Chelsea: Why did you tell Nicky/Elladine to give it a go with Lily/Rafi?
# Choiceseb "Why did I tell Nicky/Elladine to try and make it work with Lily/Rafi? (no further reactions)"
# -Because I wanted him to have a chance at winning
# -Because I didn't want him to mope
# -Because I knew he and Elladine would get back together
# The crowd makes approving sounds.
# Chelsea: That makes sense, hun.
# Chelsea: There's just one teeny moment left that I think we all want to see again.
# Background is the firepit:
# The screen shows you and LI standing around the firepit. Your faces are shown in close up as you get the final fateful text.
# The crowd watching goes wild.
# Background is the stage again:
# Choiceseb "We won... we really won..."
# -It still doesn't feel real
# thought "Maybe it'll sink in after we do the money thing."

# -It's finally sinking in
# thought "It feels pretty damn good."

# -My face is huge on that screen
# thought "I look damn good."

# Chelsea: So now it's time for the big question, my lovelies.
# Chelsea: If you'd step this way, please...
# Chelsea leads you over to a small platform. You and LI stand next to each other.
# Chelsea produces two envelopes.
# Chelsea: One of these contains the fifty thousand pound prize.
# Chelsea: Think how many tasteful throw pillows and hand-woven rugs that could buy!
# Chelsea: The other contains absolutely nothing.
# Chelsea: Like my friend Richard's apartment.
# Chelsea: Seriously babe, he thinks having a bookshelf full of games counts as interior design.
# Chelsea: Anyway...
# Chelsea: I'm going to give each of you one of these envelopes.
# Chelsea: The person with the money must then choose whether to split it with their partner, or take everything.
# Chelsea: Got that?
# She offers you a choice of two envelopes.
# You take the one closest to you, and Chelsea passes the other one to LI.
# Liona "Hey, wanna swap?"
# Choiceseb "Do I want to swap?"
# -No, that's too risky
# LI's face falls. (you get 🙁 with LI)
# Liona "So you care about the money..."
# s3_mc "Or I think this way you'll get the money."
# Liona "I didn't think of that!"

# -Sure, why not?
# LI beams hugely as [he_she] hands over [his_her] envelope. (you get 😍 with LI)
# Liona "So you don't care about the money, then?"
# s3_mc "Or I think this is my best chance to nab the whole thing."
# Liona "I didn't think of that..."

# Chelsea: We'll start with MC.
# Chelsea: Go for it, babe.
# The crowd holds its breath as you open the envelope.
# You see itai "£50,000."
# thought "I got the money!"
# LI opens [his_her] envelope and shows where it says '£0'.
# Chelsea: OK, babe, time for that big question I mentioned before.
# Chelsea: Has this experience been about love, or money?
# Choiceseb "What was Love Island all about for me?"
# -Money! Keep it all
# s3_mc "I'm taking the money."
# There's a stunned silence.
# Chelsea: R-really, babes?
# s3_mc "You heard me. I'm keeping the lot."
# Chelsea: Are... are you sure?
# s3_mc "Yes. My mind's made up."
# Chelsea swallows and then breaks out into a big grin.
# Chelsea: She's keeping the money, peeps! Big hand for MC!
# The crowd breaks into hesitant applause. You look round to see LI staring at you, open-mouthed.
# Choiceseb "[he_she] looks pretty upset..."
# -It's only money
# -We'll talk later
# Liona "What is there to say?"

# -I had my reasons
# Liona "What reasons?"

# s3_mc "Look, I..."
# Chelsea: And that's it! That was certainly a dramatic end to the season!

# -Love! Split the money with LI
# s3_mc "I'm sharing the money."
# The crowd goes wild. LI grins.
# Choiceseb "We made it!"
# -Hug LI
# You wrap your arms around LI and [he_she] does the same, like you're all he's/she's ever wanted.

# -Hug Chelsea
# You turn and throw your arms around Chelsea. She squeals in delight and hugs you back.
# Liona "Don't I get one?"
# [he_she] takes your hand and twirls you round to face [him_her].

# -Kiss LI
# You wrap your arms around LI and plant your lips on [his_her].

# The crowd dissolves into a muffled blur and for a moment, you're alone together.
# Chelsea: And that's it! Another season of Love Island ends with another amazing couple!

# Chelsea: Come on boys and girls! It's party o'clock!
# People surge past you towards the Villa. You start to move with them, but LI takes your hand.
# Liona "Let's slip away. Just the two of us."
# Liona "I want to savour every last moment with you. (splitting the money)"
# Liona "I want to talk about this. Please. (choosing the money)"
# Choiceseb "Maybe that would be nice..."
# -OK, let's chat somewhere private (gem choice)
# -Let's just join the party
# s3_mc "Let's just enjoy the party, yeah?"
# s3_mc "Everyone's waiting."
# You walk towards the Villa, then stop and hold out your hand for LI to take.
# Together, you head into the party.

# Gem choicelladine ""
# s3_mc "I think that's a great idea."
# The two of you hang back from the crowd, until you're sure nobody's looking, then you dart into the bushes that line the road.
# (choosing the money):
# Liona "MC... What happened?"
# Liona "I mean..."
# Liona "You're supposed to be my girlfriend.(agreeing to be former partners girlfriend)"
# Liona "We're supposed to be in love!(telling LI “I love you too” during the speeches)"
# Liona "...What? (not telling LI “I love you too” during the speeches on prom night)"
# Choiceseb "LI wants an explanation..."
# -I just chose randomly
# -That was my plan all along
# Liona "Really?"
# Choiceseb "Yes, I need it so I can realise my dream of..."
# -Becoming the first person to wear a bikini space
# -Starting a puppy orphanage
# s3_mc "It's always been a goal of mine, but I needed some extra cash to get it off the ground."
# s3_mc "I didn't tell you before because I knew you wouldn't understand."
# Liona "That's the greatest thing I've ever heard."
# Liona "I'm in."
# s3_mc "You are?"
# Liona "Yes, but..."

# -Opening MCland
# s3_mc "It's always been a goal of mine, but I needed some extra cash to get it off the ground."
# s3_mc "I didn't tell you before because I knew you wouldn't understand."
# Liona "That's the greatest thing I've ever heard."
# Liona "I'm in."
# s3_mc "You are?"
# Liona "Yes, but..."

# -I'm sorry, I had to
# Liona "You... had to?"
# s3_mc "Yeah. I... really need the money."
# LI takes your hand.
# Liona "Are you OK?"
# Liona "Whatever it is, you can tell me."
# Choiceseb "It's..."
# -My duty to use it to help the world
# -Cursed. You don't want it
# -My grandma. She got scammed out of her retirement
# s3_mc "She met this guy online, and he was gonna come see her, and get married, and all this stuff."
# s3_mc "We didn't realise it was going on, and by the time we figured it out, she'd sent him almost sixty grand."
# Liona "That's terrible."
# s3_mc "She's in a really bad situation. I just need to help her."
# Liona "Yeah, no, absolutely."
# Liona "I'm sorry, I didn't know."

# Liona "I just wish you'd talked to me about this."
# Liona "We've got a connection. Everyone can see it. The people out there definitely did."
# Liona "They voted us to win because they believe in us as a couple."
# Liona "And I do too."
# Liona "But you just did whatever you wanted without thinking about how I'd feel."
# Liona "I need some time to process this."
# Liona "Let's go to the party and we can discuss this later?"
# s3_mc "OK."

# (sharing the money): (Camilo is missing)
# LI takes your hands in [his_her].
# Liona "I'm glad we got to have this moment, just the two of us."
# [he_she] reaches out suddenly and pulls a leaf out of your hair.
# Liona "A bit of extra glam for the party, MC?"
# s3_mc "How did that get in there?"
# B/harry "Er, probably when we squeezed into this bush."

# s3_mc "I'm surprised you don't have an opinion about where this bush ranks compared to other bushes you've been in."
# Bill inspects the branches and leaves around you with serious intent.
# He strokes his chin.
# bill "Can't say I've been in many. But this has a nice branch structure. As a good roofer, I appreciate good stability."
# harry "I don't have any in my hair, do I?"
# Harry runs his hand through his hair. There aren't any leaves, but it makes his hair stick up a bit.
# s3_mc "Here, let me deal with it."
# You move closer until you're almost touching.
# AJ looks so proud to have found the leaf.
# You burst out laughing when you see that she has about twenty leaves sticking out of her hair.
# s3_mc "You've got a couple of leaves on you."
# She runs a hand delicately through her hair. A single leaf falls to the ground.
# aj "Did I get them?"
# s3_mc "No, here, let me."
# You move closer until you're almost touching.
# Tai plucks a leaf out of your hair.
# tai "You look like you've been playing rugby against a team of trees... and you lost."
# s3_mc "Speaking from experience?"
# tai "Yeah, actually."
# tai "To be fair, I was five."
# tai "And I lost..."
# tai "You're still beautiful as anything, though."
# tai "This might make you even more beautiful."
# He moves closer to you, the moonlight and fairy lights dapple his skin through the leaves.
# ciaran "Honestly, you're worse than Kerry."
# ciaran "When we come back from a walk she's always got all sorts stuck to her fur."
# ciaran "Thought that's not the only way you're similar."
# s3_mc "Oh?"
# He moves closer to you.
# ciaran "I think the world of you both."
# yasmin "You're like a forest nymph."
# She picks some more leaves and sticks them into your hair like a crown.
# yasmin "Beautiful."
# She looks at you with dark eyes that reflect the dappled moonlight.
# Rafi starts to sing. His voice is clear and strong, with just a hint of warm huskiness.
# It's a beautiful song, but you don't know it.
# s3_mc "What was that?"
# R: It's from a musical called 'The Nymph'. It's about a woman who is born from the forest.
# He moves closer, his steps graceful.

# The breeze gently rustles the branches around you.
# Choiceseb "What should I do?"
# -Hug [him_her]
# You wrap your arms around [him_her], digging your fingers into [his_her] lean, muscular back.
# [he_she] makes a small sound of contentment, and pulls you in tighter and closer.

# -Lie on the ground
# You plop yourself down on the soft, cool earth. LI lies next to you and drapes a hand across your stomach.
# Looking up, you can see the velvet sky and a couple of stars peeping through the leaves.
# Liona "This is pretty perfect, isn't it?"
# s3_mc "Yeah. It really is."

# -Kiss [him_her]
# You gently brush your fingers down the line of [his_her] jaw, caressing [his_her] moon-touched skin.
# You both lean in and your lips meet, as sweet and soft as the summer night around you.
# [his_her] hands follow the curve of your body as [he_she] presses in against you.

# Liona "I just want to hold on to this moment."

# "Well, my work here is coming to an end."
# "It's been a wild ride, kids."
# "I suppose I should line up my next gig."
# "Maybe I'll start pulling pints at my local while I wait for the next season to start."
# "Some of us need to work for a living."
# "Unlike MC and LI, who just made 25 thousand pounds each for 'being amazing' and 'having a great relationship'."
# "Unlike MC, who just got richer to the tune of a cool fifty thousand smackers."
# "Next time, we drop in to the most exclusive party of the year. Don't miss it!"

# Chelsea escorts you and LI over.
# Chelsea: Let's have a big round of applause for the winners of Love Island!
# (choosing the money):
# There's scattered applause. You hear someone whisper to the side of you.
# iona "I can see the money signs in her eyes."

# You pretend to put a crown on your head.

# -Strike a pose
# You put your hands on your hips.
# s3_mc "It is me, your winner."
# And then you point to your chest.

# The Islanders raise their glasses.
# Some of them are a little reluctantly. (keeping the money)

# Miki sighs heavily and rolls her eyes.
# miki "I would be fuming if someone did that to me."
# Iona laughs nervously.

# Rafi smiles slightly.
# R: Yeah, I guess you're right.
# miki "Yes!"
# miki "It's after party time."
# Everyone cheers and as the beat drops the Islanders go into full party mode.
# (only appears if you chose “I'm in!” during Hide and Seek on day 9 part 2 when talking to Elladine and Nicky about the playground):
# elladine "We should also plan a beach trip as well as our park trip, MC."

# Villa choice screen. (you can choose all)

# Chelsea, Miki, Nicky and Bill in the kitchen
# You head over to the kitchen. Everything is covered in bubbles and sand.

# miki "The one and only."
# (keeping the money):
# miki "The girl who thinks she deserves all the money for herself."
# s3_mc "Hey, I had my reasons!"
# She rolls her eyes.
# miki "Snakes have a reason for shedding their skin too."
# miki "But that doesn't mean I want to know about it."

# (Nicky left the Villa):
# nicky "I've got to say, leaving this place like that was properly scary."
# Chelsea: Yeah! That was so dramatic.
# Chelsea: I've only just picked my jaw up off the floor.
# Choiceseb "When Nicky walked out of the Villa..."
# -Less competition for me and LI...
# s3_mc "All the more winnings for me!"
# Nicky frowns and the others look at each other awkwardly. (you get 🙁 with Nicky)
# miki "Wow."
# miki "You really are, like, something else."
# miki "And that something is not good."
# Miki clears her throat and turns away from you.

# -I was so sad to see him go
# nicky "Aw, MC!"
# nicky "Really?"
# s3_mc "Yeah. It was like losing a part of me."

# Nicky shakes his head, smiling. (you get 🙂 with Nicky)
# nicky "As sweet as that is, I don't think I could have beaten you and LI."
# nicky "You guys were the clear winners."
# Chelsea: That's right!
# (Nicky didn't leave the Villa):
# Miki is playing with the sand with her feet. It's kind of sludge because it has mixed up with the bubbles.
# miki "The sand is so soft."
# Chelsea: I tested them all out to make sure I got the right sand.
# miki "This place really does look amazing."
# Chelsea: Aw, thanks!
# Chelsea: I've conjured up my favourite Bs for the theme?
# Chelsea: In fact, I'd say they are the ultimate double B's.
# Chelsea: 'Beach and Bubbles'.
# Choiceseb "What do I think of the party theme?"
# -I'm allergic to bubbles
# Chelsea: Oh, MC, don't worry!
# Chelsea: I got the hypo-allergenic stuff!

# -Beach and bubbles is genius
# Chelsea: I'm so glad you think so.

# -Is this a foam party?
# Chelsea: Oh, no way girl.
# Chelsea: A bubble party is, like, way more fancy.
# bill "Maybe if you put all the bubbles together you can make foam!"
# nicky "I went to a foam party once and legit nearly drowned so I'm kind of thankful it's not one of those."

# Chelsea: The idea came to me in a dream.
# s3_mc "Oh, yeah?"
# miki "What was the dream about?"
# Chelsea: So, I was floating in a bubble.
# Chelsea: And below me you lot were all dancing about on the beach.
# Chelsea: At first I thought it meant that I was jealous of you lot in the Villa.
# nicky "That's deep."
# Chelsea: But then I realised...
# Chelsea: It was a sign of what the party theme had to be!
# bill "That is a logical interpretation of your dream."
# Chelsea: Yeah, but then it got weirder.
# Choiceseb "Chelsea had a dream about us..."
# -What else happened in the dream?
# Chelsea: You all started building this giant sandcastle and then MC, you climbed on the top and helped me out of the bubble!
# Chelsea: And then we crowned you the queen of the sand kingdom.
# You put a hand on your head where your crown would be.
# s3_mc "As it should be."

# -I always have dreams about this place
# Chelsea: Literally, same.
# Chelsea: Once I dreamed of an entire alternate villa which was kind of funny.

# -I hope it got steamy
# Chelsea: No, I didn't notice any condensation in the bubble.
# Chelsea: You all started building this giant sandcastle and then MC, you climbed on the top and helped me out of the bubble!
# Chelsea: And then we crowned you the queen of the sand kingdom.
# You put a hand on your head where your crown would be.
# s3_mc "As it should be."

# nicky "What are you up to now Chelsea?"
# nicky "In the real world?"
# Chelsea: Oh, well interior decorating and event organising mainly?
# Chelsea: That's why I'm here running the after party.
# nicky "Makes sense. This place is awesome!"
# (Miki was dumped):
# miki "You know, it's funny, but you were the person who actually popped my winning bubble, MC."
# s3_mc "Winning bubble?"
# M. Yeah!
# She sticks her tongue out jokingly.
# miki "You sent me home."
# Your cheeks flush red.
# Choiceseb "I sent Miki home earlier in the Villa!"
# -You were never going to win
# -It was nothing personal
# miki "I'm sure, hun."
# She winks at you.
# miki "It's all good."

# -I wish I could have saved you too
# Miki laughs.
# miki "I'm kidding, I'm kidding."
# miki "There's no hard feelings!"

# miki "But how does it feel to win?"

# miki "Speaking of awesome dreams coming true...(Miki was not dumped)"
# miki "How does it feel?(Miki was not dumped)"
# Choiceseb "It feels..."
# -Like I'm dreaming
# s3_mc "I'm scared I'm going to wake up and someone is going to go..."
# s3_mc "And it was all a dream!"
# miki "Aw, babe. That's not going to happen; this is all very real."

# -Like I went for a stroll in a park
# nicky "Really?"
# nicky "Was it that easy?"
# s3_mc "Yeah, it's been a doodle."

# -Like I can conquer anything now
# miki "You sure can."

# You squeeze Bill's hand. He smiles at you.
# bill "Honestly, I feel like the luckiest guy around right now."
# Choiceseb "Bill feels like the luckiest guy in the world!"
# -I feel exactly the same
# s3_mc "I'm the luckiest girl!"
# Chelsea: Aw, you two! Perfect match.

# -It's not luck, we worked hard to win
# bill "That's right."

# -I am your lucky charm
# bill "You know, I never believed in lucky charms before I met you."

# bill "And not only did we win Love Island but I also..."
# bill "Found love."
# bill "And in my opinion that's the best thing."
# nicky "Did you expect to win?"
# s3_mc "Obviously. (if you chose “us, of course” when LI asks you who's gonna win)"
# s3_mc "Honestly, no! I didn't have any idea. (if you chose “I don't know” when LI asks you who's gonna win)"
# nicky "Yeah, I thought you would as well, not going to lie."
# AJ whizzes in, looking a little bit out of breath.
# aj "Phew..."
# s3_mc "You alright, babe?"
# aj "Oh, hey gorgeous."
# She kisses your cheek.
# aj "Side note, by the way, you look amazing."
# AJ. I'm so glad I got to win with you.
# You blush, AJ smiles at you sincerely.
# Chelsea: You alright, AJ?
# aj "Yeah! I ran over to tell you that the bubble mixture has run out."
# Chelsea: Oh no!
# Chelsea: You don't mean...
# aj "There are no bubbles."
# Choiceseb "There are no bubbles!"
# -Quick! Everybody! Panic!
# s3_mc "Panic at the disco!"

# -Wow, AJ and Chelsea are both bubbles of energy
# thought "They're like, really similar but also really different."

# -Try blowing bubbles with the soap by the sink
# You run to the sink and grab a bottle of soap.
# s3_mc "No one panic!"
# s3_mc "We've got backup."
# Chelsea: Oh, MC... don't worry!
# Chelsea: I've got some more liquid already prepared.
# You turn off the tap, but the sink is already overflowing with  soap bubbles, which runs down your leg.
# Chelsea: But I appreciate your dedication.

# Chelsea claps her hands enthusiastically.
# Chelsea: Lesson one of a good party.
# Chelsea: The bubble liquid and the champagne glasses must always be topped up.
# Chelsea: Keep partying, Islanders. (Chelsea leaves the kitchen)
# miki "I hope she doesn't mix those two up..."

# Genevieve, Seb, Iona and Elladine on the lawn
# Some of the Islanders are taking a breather from dancing.
# Genevieve/Seb/Elladine waves you over. (Depending on who's BFF of them)
# genevieve "Hey, MC."

# Rafi comes over, dancing to the music.
# R: Hey, my gorgeous partner in crime.

# s3_mc "We sure did."
# He tries to manage a smile. (choosing the money)
# R: And you took all the money.(choosing the money)
# genevieve "Yeah, plot twist or what?(choosing the money)"
# He shudders dramatically.(choosing the money)
# R: Hi, all. (MC not coupled with Rafi)

# genevieve "Oh yeah, you're sort of famous aren't you?"
# He smiles proudly.
# R: You bet.
# R: I miss acting a lot.
# genevieve "Yeah that must be weird, like, I know we're on camera here but we're not acting are we?"
# R: I can't wait to pretend to be someone else again.
# Choiceseb "Rafi misses his acting..."
# -I don't think I could be an actor
# s3_mc "I would get tired of all the pretending."
# R: Nah, I guess it's not for everyone.

# -Give us a show now
# s3_mc "You should give us a show."
# He smiles.
# R: You don't have to ask me twice.
# Rafi jumps up and points at you.

# genevieve "And on that thought..."
# genevieve "I'm going to top up my glass and get back to the dance!"
# R: Yes, come on you lot.
# R: Let's dance!

# Camilo, Ciaran, Tai and Yasmin on the roof terrace
# Some of the other Islanders are chilling on the roof terrace sipping champagne as the party continues down in the Villa.
# s3_mc "Hey, folks."
# tai "Hey money bags...(keeping the money)"
# The others chuckle. You roll your eyes.(keeping the money)
# s3_mc "Meh, I don't think that'll get old.(keeping the money)"
# tai "Hey gorgeous.(sharing the money)"
# s3_mc "What's going on up here?"
# Yasmin points to the sky.
# yasmin "We're trying to spot the first star tonight."
# tai "It'll be the last ever first star we see in the Villa."
# camilo "Is that really a thing?"
# camilo "Spotting the first star at night?"
# ciaran "Yeah! It's good luck."
# Choiceseb "The Islanders are looking for the first star at night..."
# -This is so not a real thing
# -It's me! I'm the star of the show
# s3_mc "No need to look any further."
# You point at yourself.
# s3_mc "I'm your star!"
# s3_mc "Maybe I should get a star and name it MC..."
# yasmin "You sure are."
# The others laugh.

# -You should make a wish on it
# ciaran "I don't need to!"
# ciaran "I've got everything I ever wanted now."
# tai "I'd wish for more time to spend here with you lot."
# Ciaran grins and hugs him tightly.
# ciaran "Same."
# Choiceseb "I'd wish..."
# -To win Love Island
# yasmin "Um... babe, you know you've already won, right?"
# s3_mc "What... really!?, Oh, wow. It just hasn't hit me yet."
# yasmin "It will soon, MC."

# -For a sense of belonging outside of here
# The others nod, smiling sadly.
# camilo "I'm well sad that it's going to be the end so soon."
# tai "You took the words right out of my mouth, MC."

# -That we'd all always be happy and healthy
# yasmin "Aw, that's a cute wish, MC."

# tai "Maybe the star is out just for you, MC."
# ciaran "Nah, they're probably out to help people sailing boats."
# ciaran "Like “Shipname”."
# yasmin "You know ship names are not actually, like, directly related to a ship?"
# (keeping the money and MC coupled with Camilo/Tai/Ciaran):
# yasmin "I could see you running around your own ship to be fair."
# Camilo/Tai/Ciaran shrugs.
# Cam/T/ciaran "Yeah, maybe."
# (sharing the money):
# ciaran "Let's get a boat called MCran?"
# He points to the bottle of champagne.
# ciaran "And then do that crack the bottle against the side thing that they do with the champagne."
# yasmin "I don't think that's the point of a ship name, hun."
# yasmin "You don't need a literal ship."
# ciaran "I always wanted to learn how to sail, to be fair."
# (MC not coupled with Ciaran):
# tai "Legit, I used to think that ship names were actual ships."
# s3_mc "Really?"
# tai "Yeah, I would have thought you'd meant you were buying a boat or something."
# Choiceseb "Living on a boat with LI..."
# -That sounds like paradise (Ciaran as partner missing)
# You kiss the top of your thumb and index finger.
# s3_mc "Chefs kiss perfection."
# s3_mc "I can't wait to see the world with LI. (MC not coupled with Tai/Yasmin/ Camilo/Ciaran) "
# tai "Yeah, that would be swell. We could sail all around New Zealand."
# camilo "Yeah, rock, rock, rock your boat."
# yasmin "I've always wanted to, like, live on a boat."
# s3_mc "We could ask Miki for tips."
# yasmin "That would be so cute. I always watch those boat conversion videos."

# -We would wreck that ship
# s3_mc "That ship would be sunk in no time."
# yasmin "Aw, don't build a ship to wreck!"

# -That could be our reality spin off TV series
# yasmin "You could ask Miki for tips."
# yasmin "She must know loads about living on the water."

# Yasmin sips her drink. Her face scrunches up in disgust.
# yasmin "Is it just me or does this champagne taste a little funny?"
# Camilo takes an indulgent sip.
# camilo "Nah, it's lush."
# camilo "In all seriousness, can you believe it's the finale?"
# yasmin "Yeah, I feel like we've all been living in like space for a year or two."
# (MC not ending with Yasmin):
# yasmin "I think I'd prefer something a little more local to my family."
# yasmin "Being here has made me realise how much I miss my mum."
# yasmin "Tempted to go back to stay with her for a bit."

# (MC not ending with Yasmin/AJ/Lily):
# camilo "Would you ever consider moving abroad, MC?"
# Choiceseb "Would I ever consider moving abroad?"
# -Nah, I'm a home bird
# camilo "Yeah, I always wanted to move abroad but I couldn't be that far away from the fam."

# -Can I move to Mars?
# ciaran "Strictly speaking it's probably a worthwhile investment, what with climate change and all that."
# yasmin "Yeah, maybe one day, MC."
# tai "Nah, we can't just be going from planet to planet destroying everything"
# in our wake.
# tai "We've got to save what we've already got first!"
# ciaran "Woah, yeah. You're right. Answering Bowie's question can wait."
# tai "Huh?"
# ciaran "Is there life on Mars?"
# Tai looks confused.
# ciaran "Don't worry mate. I'll teach you all about the star man."

# -If LI is with me I'll go anywhere
# yasmin "Aw, you cutie."
# tai "Yeah, we ought to figure that out."
# tai "We could do six months here and six months back in New Zealand."
# Cam. Don't worry, babe.
# camilo "I'm not moving anywhere just yet."
# ciaran "Ireland, here we come!"

# (MC ending with AJ/Yasmin/Lily):
# camilo "What about you two?"
# He points at Ciaran and Tai.
# camilo "Where are you guys going to live?"
# Ciaran smiles at Tai.
# tai "We had a bit of a chat about it, didn't we?"
# ciaran "We got stuck trying to work out what part of the world we'd be in."
# ciaran "I suggested that we could do six months in Ireland and six months in New Zealand."
# tai "Yeah, then we started looking at maps, working out what's halfway between Ireland and New Zealand..."
# tai "So, long story short, we had a whole lot of ideas for holidays, but no real answer to the question."
# ciaran "I think we'll just play it by ear for the time being. It's been quite a journey already."
# tai "True. We'll figure it out."
# Tai takes Ciaran's hand.

# camilo "You know what?"
# camilo "Whatever happens in the future..."
# camilo "I'm just so glad we all got to hang out this summer."
# camilo "It's been awesome."
# Choiceseb "Camilo's glad we had this time together."
# -I wish we had more time
# yasmin "Yeah, I wish we could go back and do it all again."
# tai "Me too."
# He smiles at you, blushing.

# -This whole thing went way too fast
# ciaran "I think that's what happens when you're not worrying about, like, the future and stuff."

# -Same, I wouldn't change it for the world
# tai "Nah, me neither."
# He smiles at you and gently squeezes your hand.

# camilo "Yeah, totally."
# Camilo points to the sky.
# camilo "Hey. Look!"
# camilo "There it is."
# camilo "The first star."
# A small speck of light appears on the horizon.
# ciaran "The last first star."
# Choiceseb "We saw the last first star..."
# -Make your wish
# You close your eyes and make a wish. Yasmin and Camilo do the same.

# -Wave at the planet
# You wave frantically at the 'star'.
# s3_mc "Hello, other life forms!"
# s3_mc "We come in peace."
# Seb shouts from the grass below, waving back at you.
# seb "What did you say?"
# s3_mc "We come in peace!"
# seb "Cheese?"
# s3_mc "Peace?!"
# seb "Peas?"
# seb "What kind of party are you throwing up there?"

# -Get everyone in a group hug
# s3_mc "Come on you lot."
# You wrap your arms around Camilo and Yasmin. Ciaran jumps in the middle.
# ciaran "Ciaran sandwich!"
# Tai wraps his huge arms around you all. You squeeze each other tight before reluctantly letting go.
# yasmin "I will miss you lot so much."
# s3_mc "Same."

# The others stay to watch the stars slowly light up the night sky as you head downstairs.

# Everyone is dancing and laughing together on the lawn. The beat is infectious.
# BFF spins you around.
# bff "Come on, MC. Show us what you've got!"
# Choiceseb "I should..."
# -Do the spooky skeleton
# You wildly throw your legs and arms around in time with the music.
# BFF copies you. Her/His legs fly in all different directions.

# -Start a conga with BFF
# You spin her/him around and put your arms on BFF's shoulders.
# You both dance around the lawn. You kick your legs out in time with the music.
# bff "Join us!"
# ciaran "Yes! Conga."
# Chelsea: Woo! Conga!
# It's not long before the whole group is snaking around the lawn.
# s3_mc "Follow the leader, leader."
# thought "Or should I say the winner."
# Eventually the crowd disperse out of the conga line.

# -Pivot! Pivot! Pivot!
# You start spinning around in circles, balancing on the tips of your toes.
# BFF cheers as you finish off your pivot with a bow.
# bff "Bravo, bravo! Encore!"

# bff "You know, as this is the final party, MC."
# bff "We've got to, like, seal the deal on our friendship."
# Choiceseb "Hmmm, how should we seal the deal on our friendship?"
# -Let's hug it out
# s3_mc "Come here, you."
# You hug each other tightly.

# -Quick, let's do a cool handshake
# You put your hands out and slap each other in all different directions.
# bff "Wow, it's like we'd practised that before!"
# bff "We're just so in sync."

# -Booty bump
# s3_mc "Let's do a booty bump!"
# G/elladine "Aw, yes! Let's get it, girl."
# S/nicky "What's that?"
# s3_mc "It's what it says on the tin. We bump our booties together."
# S/nicky "Uh, OK!"
# You stick your bum out. BFF does the same.
# You both swing your hips and bump your booties together.
# G/elladine "Now we're bum babes! (you get 🥰 with Genevieve/Elladine)"
# S/nicky "Now we're bum bros! (you get 🥰 with Seb/Nicky)"
# You sling an arm around BFF's shoulder as you both laugh.

# LI taps your shoulder from behind.
# Liona "Hey, you two."
# bff "Hey, other winner!"
# N/seb "I'll leave you to it."
# G/elladine "Want to dance with me?"
# Genevieve/Elladine pulls LI to her, and they begin to clumsily waltz to the music.
# G/elladine "Have you come to tell us you were really only with MC so you could get with me."
# Choiceseb "Genevieve/Elladine and LI... (no further reactions)"
# -They'd make a cute couple
# -Not on my watch
# -Let's all be a throuple!
# Genevieve/Elladine laughs. LI looks puzzled as [he_she] is twirled around this way and that.
# Liona "Uh..."
# Genevieve/Elladine spins LI into you.
# G/elladine "I'm kidding, I'm kidding."
# G/elladine "She's all yours."
# G/elladine "I'll leave you to it."

# The perfect slow dancing song begins to play and the Islanders around you break off into couples.
# You and LI gravitate towards each other.
# [he_she] holds you in [his_her] arms and together you slowly sway to the music.
# LI whispers in your ear.
# Liona "You're beautiful."
# [his_her] breath makes the hair on the back of your neck stand up.
# You look around.
# Everyone is dancing and kissing.
# s3_mc "There sure is something in the air tonight."
# Liona "Yeah, it's getting hot out here."
# LI bites [his_her] lips.
# s3_mc "It sure is."
# thought "Now would be a good time to have a private chat with LI."

# You slip your hand into LI's and lead [him_her] off to the side.
# Liona "This is a good time to tell you..."
# LI leans in and whispers in your ear.
# Liona "I have something I want to show you back in the Villa."
# You giggle excitedly and bite your lip.
# (keeping the money):
# s3_mc "Before we get to that can I just, like, address the elephant in the room?"
# LI looks around.
# Liona "Babe, we're outside, and I don't see any elephants."
# s3_mc "It's about the money..."
# Liona "Oh, right, yeah."
# s3_mc "I know you needed time to process, but I don't want it hanging over us... you know?"
# s3_mc "Let's just be honest with each other and, like, clear the air."
# LI takes a deep breath and grips your hand tighter.
# Liona "Honestly, I was hurt... I am still hurt."
# Liona "And again, it isn't about the money. I know you had your reasons."
# Liona "But communication is key, OK? It was, like, a bit of a shock."
# s3_mc "I'll communicate better next time I steal your money. I'll give you a heads up."
# LI looks at you, confused.
# s3_mc "Too soon?"
# Liona "No you're good. We have to be able to laugh I guess."
# Liona "Now, where were we?"
# MC. Private time?
# Liona "Oh yeah..."
# Liona "Since it's our final night in the Villa, I kind of..."
# Liona "Prepared you a scavenger hunt."
# s3_mc "You did?"
# Liona "I hid a few little bits around the Villa."
# Liona "We can find them together, and also have one last private moment together."
# thought "With everyone outside, we could get away with doing anything inside..."
# Choiceseb "Do I want to do LI's scavenger hunt?"
# -Yes! Let's go (gem choice)
# -But leaving the party first is lame...
# Liona "We won't be leaving the party, just, like... taking a little detour."
# thought "Hmm, I don't want to be that person who leaves super early..."
# thought "But we could always come back to the party straight afterwards."
# Choiceseb "I'm sure no one would notice..."
# -Risk it and go with LI (gem choice)
# -Just stay at the party
# s3_mc "Sorry babe, it's the last time we'll see this lot for ages."
# s3_mc "I'd rather stay here."
# Liona "No problem. It was a silly idea anyway."
# Liona "Plenty of time for that scavenger hunting stuff later."
# LI looks at you, smiling.
# Liona "You look lost in thought, MC!"
# s3_mc "Just lost in your eyes, gorgeous."

# Gem choice:
# s3_mc "I'm up for it if you are."
# LI looks at you, smiling.
# Liona "Where should we look first?"
# Liona "I hid some stuff in the living room, the bathroom, and on the roof"
# Choiceseb "Where should we look? (choices are not repeatable)"
# -I'd like to chill here for a bit
# -Let's go up on the roof
# Liona "Awesome. I love it up there! We should go."

# -Let's go in the living room
# Liona "To the living room then, let's go."

# -Let's search the bathroom
# Liona "Bathroom. Cool. Got it!"

# (appears only after visiting the first place):
# Liona "You tell me where to go next, babe."
# Liona "Or we can just stay here and chill."

# Roof terrace:
# You both step out onto the roof terrace.
# The moon hangs huge and low in the sky, casting shadows on LI's features.
# [he_she] catches you staring.
# Liona "What?"
# s3_mc "Nothing. You just look so good in the moonlight..."
# Liona "Aw, babe."
# You immediately notice a little plastic bag sitting on the bench.
# s3_mc "Wow, you hid this one so well, babe."
# Liona "I was in a rush, OK?"
# You pick up the bag and open it. There is a packet of crisps inside.
# Liona "I raided the cupboards earlier and kept you your favourite."
# Liona "I thought you might have been hungry by now."
# Choiceseb "LI got me some crisps!"
# -Scaff the whole bag
# s3_mc "You know how snacky I get!"
# You devout the crisps, munching gleefully, tossing the packet to the side.
# Liona "That's my girl."

# -Give them to LI
# s3_mc "I'm not some monster who can't go an hour without food!"
# Liona "Well I am, so gimme here."
# [he_she] grabs the crisps from you and pours them into [his_her] mouth, munching gleefully. You look on in amused shock.
# Liona "What? I'm not going to let them go to waste!"
# LI quickly scoffs the bag and puts it on the side.

# -Share them with LI
# You open up the bag and both help yourself to the crisps.
# LI licks the packet before discarding it to the side.
# Liona "Can't let the flavour of the packet get away."
# s3_mc "Truth. That's the best bit."

# Liona "I wonder who, like, invented the crisp."
# Liona "They are a genius whoever they are."
# LI smiles, nervously folding the discarded crisp packer over and over on itself.
# Liona "So are you enjoying my scavenger hunt?"
# Choices:
# -Nah, I'm exhausted
# -Yeah, but maybe we should make the most of this alone again? (only appears if you went to the living room first and did bits)
# LI nods and grins at you.
# s3_mc "Let's do it like they do in nature documentaries."
# Liona "In the middle of a field?"
# s3_mc "No! Under the stars on the roof."
# Liona "Ah, right! I don't remember nature documentaries featuring a huge amount of roof bits."
# You sigh and roll your eyes. LI sticks [his_her] tongue out, throwing the crisps to the side.
# Liona "Come on, you."
# You rush over to the bench and lie down, LI lies down beside you.
# The sound of the party is still booming from below. The bass shakes the house a little bit.
# Choiceseb "We're doing bits on the roof!"
# -At least we don't have to worry about being heard
# Liona "Yeah! Sounds like the party's still going hard."

# -I'm officially an up and coming star
# LI snorts with laughter.
# s3_mc "What? It's true!"
# Liona "Speaking of..."

# -This roof has seen a lot of action
# Liona "It sure has..."

# LI points up to the sky.
# Liona "The stars look beautiful tonight."
# Liona "But not nearly as beautiful as you."
# You grin and then with a swerve of your hips you pull LI on top of you.
# Liona "Wow."
# Your hands, resting on the nape of [his_her] back, pull [him_her] closer.
# Your bodies fumble for each other's touch under the silken night sky.
# It's hot, heavy, fast.
# You move in time with the insatious beat coming from the party below.
# LI slowly sits up beside you.
# Liona "Well, that was amazing."
# s3_mc "Thanks. You weren't too bad yourself."
# [he_she] laughs. You wink at [him_her] jokingly.
# Liona "Oh, hang on. You've got something stuck on your back."
# [he_she] scootches around you and peels something off of your lower back.
# Liona "Looks like we've been getting frisky and crispy."
# LI holds up the discarded crisp packet.
# s3_mc "Ha! Oops."
# s3_mc "Luckily we already finished them."
# LI nods and grins at you.

# -Yeah! Where can we go next?
# LI nods and grins at you.
# Liona "You tell me where to get next, babe."

# -I'd rather be doing bits, not going to lie (same scene as “Yeah, but maybe we should make the most of this alone again?”)

# (Roof terrace as last option):
# [he_she] plants a kiss on your cheek. You pull [him_her] close, and you kiss under the starlit sky.
# Liona "Did not expect the scavenger hunt to be quite so tiring."
# [he_she] winks at you.
# Liona "You're amazing."
# You sit next to each other for a while.
# Listening to your breath rise and fall.
# Liona "I could sit with you forever."
# Liona "Just doing nothing."
# s3_mc "Me too..."
# Liona "Hey, isn't that what people do when they live together?"
# Liona "Like, dating is fun and all but we've already practised living together."
# s3_mc "I guess we have."
# [he_she] glances at you, stroking your shoulders absentmindedly.
# Liona "Would you want that?"
# Liona "To move in together, like?"
# Choiceseb "Would I want to move in with LI?"
# -Sure, but you have to pick up your towels
# Liona "I'll try my best!"

# -No, I don't think I'm ready for that
# LI. That's OK, babe. We can take this whole relationship thing at your pace.

# -Yes and let's have babies while we're at it
# LI laughs.
# Y/AJ/L: Yes. I've always wanted to have kids. We'll have to look at what our options are and stuff!
# Y/AJ/L: Should we be called mom and mum?
# Y/AJ/L: There's a lot to decide. But I legit want it all with you.
# B/H/Cam/T/C/R: Yeah, I'm sure I can manage that.

# LI leans on your shoulder and squeezes your hand.
# bff "Hey, MC! LI!"
# bff "Where have you gone off to?"
# Liona "The calm never lasts long does it?"
# s3_mc "Not around this lot."
# LI stands up and offers [his_her] hand to you.
# You clutch it tightly as [he_she] pulls you up.
# Liona "Let's go back out there and face the world."

# Bathroom:
# You and LI walk into the bathroom.
# thought "Right..."
# thought "I wonder where LI could have hidden something in here..."
# Choiceseb "Where should I look? (no further reactions)"
# -Down the sink plug hole
# -In the back of the toilet
# -Amongst the tooth brushes

# Just as you're about to peer in, LI coughs loudly.
# Liona "Nope. Cold!"
# Liona "It's definitely not in there..."

# Liona "I'll give you a clue."
# Liona "You have to get cold to get hot."
# Choiceseb "You have to get cold to get hot..."
# -The fridge!
# -The cold tap!
# Liona "Ding, ding, ding. We have a winner!"

# -A cold shower!
# Liona "Ha! No, but good guess..."
# [he_she] gestures to the bath.
# Liona "It's by the cold tap."
# s3_mc "Ah, very sneaky."

# You reach behind the tap.
# It's a (vegan/vegetarian) mayo sachet.
# Bill laughs as you pick it up.
# bill "Now we can have the perfect breakfast together."
# bill "Bon happy eat!"
# It's a piece of cardboard with the numbers '5:00am' scrawled on it in eyeliner.
# harry "See? It says five in the morning!"
# harry "Now you'll never forget what time is my favourite time of day to get up."
# harry "Maybe you'll get up with me when we're... like, you know... back home."
# It's a piece of tinfoil shaped like an aeroplane.
# camilo "I know it looks kind of funny but it's meant to symbolise all the cool places I'm going to take you when we're, like, back in the real world."
# It's a small piece of tinfoil made into the shape of a hockey stick.
# aj "Now you're really one of the team!"
# aj "It's lucky too. I put a stray eyelash in it and wished lots of good things on it."
# It's a piece of broken pottery.
# tai "I chipped a bit of my pottery from the piece my dad gave me for good luck."
# tai "Thought you could have the other half. "
# tai "Sort of like how you have the other half of my heart."
# tai "Don't worry though, I sanded down all the edges."
# It's a small piece of tinfoil which he's shaped like a dog tag.
# You can make out the words 'Ciaran and MC 4 eva'
# ciaran "I was going to put just my name on it but then I thought that might be a bit weird so I put both of us on it."
# He opens his palm. He has another one just like it.
# ciaran "And we've got matching ones!"
# It's her stuffed animal.
# yasmin "I thought you might as well look after it."
# yasmin "You can hug it when you, like, want to give me a hug."
# She grins.
# yasmin "Though if I'm in the area you should definitely hug me first."
# It's a piece of cardboard with the number '9' drawn on it.
# R/L: I figured this was probably our lucky number as I can in, like, when you'd been here for nine days.

# Choiceseb "Oh wow, LI that is..."
# -Actually kinda weird
# -The sweetest thing ever. I'll treasure it forever
# s3_mc "Literally, this is the best."
# s3_mc "Thank you so much."

# -So wonderfully random
# Liona "Sorry, I just didn't have a lot of time or resources."
# Liona "So I had to make to with what I had."
# You shrug it off and smile.
# s3_mc "That's OK babe. It's cute!"

# (bathroom as last option):
# [he_she] kisses your cheek as you both slump down on the mat. Exhausted but happy. (same scene as roof terrace last option is following)

# (bathroom not as last option):
# LI smiles.
# Liona "Not going to lie, I think my other treasures weren't as, like, thought out as this one."
# Liona "So just keep in mind I had, like, no time to make this at all."
# You laugh. LI blushes.

# Living room:
# You enter the living room with LI and look around.
# s3_mc "Everything looks normal..."
# Liona "That's the point of hiding things, babe."
# LI lays down on the couch while you start to search the room.
# s3_mc "Am I getting hotter or colder?"
# Liona "Oh, you're definitely hot, but not, like in the game sense."
# s3_mc "Help me! I can't find it."
# Liona "Ok, you're cold."
# You step toward LI.
# Liona "Warmer..."
# You keep moving forward, your knees bumping into the couch.
# Liona "Hotter!"
# You slip your hand under one of the couch cushions and pull out...
# s3_mc "A note!"
# You sit down next to LI and open it.
# The note has been written with eyeliner.
# s3_mc "'You are cute.'"
# s3_mc "Is... that it?"
# Liona "You don't like it?"
# Choiceseb "LI' asking if I like the note..."
# -You're cute too
# Liona "Thanks, babe!"

# -It's a bit short
# Liona "Short and snappy, you know?"
# Liona "I did it while you were in the shower this morning."

# -No, I love it
# LI beams at you.
# Liona "I'm so glad."

# Liona "I know it's only a little thing, I didn't have long, but I wanted to make today special for us."
# Liona "I also didn't want to, like, break the eyeliner."
# Liona "Those things are expensive!"
# s3_mc "Aw, really? That's so sweet of you, babe."
# You lean in to kiss LI on the cheek.
# Liona "Oh, now you're really getting hotter now..."
# LI cocks an eyebrow.
# Liona "So, how's about it? There's no one else around..."
# Choiceseb "Should we live it up in the living room?"
# -Nah, I'd rather not
# s3_mc "Nah, I'm OK, babe."
# LI. Sure thing.

# -Yes, let's do bits!
# s3_mc "I want you so bad."
# s3_mc "Even if you did just 'cute' me."
# Liona "You're cute and hot at the same time which is, like, a double threat."
# You straddle LI as [he_she] sits on the sofa.
# Choiceseb "I should..."
# -Tickle [him_her]
# You softly run your fingers along [his_her] stomach up towards [his_her] armpits.
# s3_mc "Tickle time!"
# Liona "Hey!"
# You pull back, and run your fingers slowly down [his_her] body, teasing [him_her].
# Liona "That's more like it."

# -Stroke [his_her] thigh
# You run your fingers up the inside of [his_her] thigh with an aching slowness.

# -Kiss LI's neck
# You kiss LI on [his_her] neck.
# [his_her] body shudders at your touch.
# Liona "You drive me wild."

# [he_she] tips [his_her] head back. [his_her] eyes widen.
# [his_her] back arches.
# Liona "Oh, wow. MC."
# There are pillows and cushions all over the floor.
# s3_mc "We sure livened up this living room."

# (living room as last option):
# You both slump down on the sofa. (same scene as roof terrace last option is following)

# (living room not as last option):
# You get up from the sofa.
# LI holds your hand for a second.
# s3_mc "So, where else are you hiding things?"
# LI taps the side of [his_her] nose.

# You hurry back to the group, hand in hand.
# Everyone's still partying.
# bff "Where did you two go!?"
# You smile cheekily. LI blushes.
# s3_mc "Just for a chat."

# bff "Get over here you two."
# miki "Or you can stay over there.(keeping the money)"
# iona "Yeah, we won't mind.(keeping the money)"
# BFF rolls her/his eyes.(keeping the money)
# bff "Just ignore them, babe!(keeping the money)"
# BFF beckons you over. The Islanders gather around you.
# tai "Group hug!"
# ciaran "“Shipname” sandwich!"
# Everyone holds each other tightly.
# camilo "I will miss you lot."
# iona "Me too."
# Liona "I love you all so much."
# LI smiles at you and squeezes your hand.
# Liona "I can't wait for whatever comes next!"

# "I guess I'm going to have to enjoy this veggie roast myself."
# "Apparently it's not proper party food."
# "Next time on Love Island..."
# "There is no next time."
# "This is the end!"
# "The end for these Islanders anyway."
# "I'll still be in my shed doing things that people do in a shed."
# "If you ever need someone to narrate sarcastic commentary over your life just send me a text."
# "I take payment in precious shiny gems."

# Congratulations! You have won Love Island and completed the story for this season.
