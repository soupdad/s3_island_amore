# "Last time on Love Island‚Ä¶"
# "The ball was finally back in MC's court."
# (if MC chose the same person as on the first day:)
# "No prizes for guessing who she went for‚Ä¶"
# s3_mc "The person I'd like to couple up with is‚Ä¶Bill/Harry/Camilo."
# "Yes, two days after losing him, she's back with Bill/Harry/Camilo‚Ä¶"
# "It's like watching a ping pong match in slow motion."
# (if MC didn't choose the same person as on first day:)
# "And instead of going for Bill/Camilo/Harry, she decided to surprise everyone and change things up‚Ä¶"
# s3_mc "The person I'd like to couple up with is‚Ä¶Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ."
# "As expected, there was no end of crying, accusations of broken girl code and‚Ä¶"
# M/G/I/seb "I really didn't want to cause a scene."
# M/G/I/seb "I don't want you to think I'm in a mood with you or anything. I'm not."
# "Wait, what? I must have tuned into the wrong channel. It looked like Miki/Genevieve/Iona/Seb was handling it well."
# "Coming up‚Ä¶"
# "One of the boys isn't in the mood for some friendly ribbing‚Ä¶"
# bill "What are you doing, mate?"
# "And there was me thinking it was just going to be a nice relaxing day by the pool."

# All is quiet in the Villa, except for a few soft snores.
# You wake up wrapped up in Bill's/Harry's/Camilo's/AJ's strong arms.
# You take a moment to watch him/her sleep.
# thought "After all that time being single, it's actually nice to wake up next to someone."
# Choiceseb "Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ looks‚Ä¶"
# -Cute as a button
# thought "I could stare at him/her for hours."

# -Hot like fiyah
# thought "It's ridiculous. Who looks that hot first thing in the morning?"

# -Funny..
# thought "He/She looks totally out of it. I could totally draw on his face‚Ä¶"

# Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ stirs, opens his/her eyes and catches you gazing at him/her.
# B/H/Cam/aj "Were you watching me sleep?"
# Choiceseb "Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ caught me watching him‚Ä¶"
# -Can you blame me?
# s3_mc "You're gorgeous. I couldn't help myself."
# B/H/camilo "You're not too bad yourself. (You get üòç with Bill/Harry/Camilo)"
# aj "You're pretty fit too. (You get üòç with AJ)"

# -You sleep funny (MC coupled with AJ)
# s3_mc "You stick your arms out so wide, you look like a scarecrow."
# B/H/camilo "Is that a good thing? (You get üôÅ with Bill/Harry/Camilo)"
# s3_mc "It's funny!"
# H/B/camilo "I'll take your word for it."
# H/B/camilo "Let's start again."

# -Who, me?
# B/H/camilo "Yeah you, silly."
# s3_mc "I don't know what you're talking about."
# B/H/Cam/aj "Aw, you're embarrassed. I thought it was cute."

# Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ smiles and stretches before wrapping his/her arms around you and pulling you closer.
# B/H/Cam/aj "Morning."
# You're so close your noses are almost touching. You can feel the warmth of Bill's/Harry's/Camilo's/AJ's breath.
# B/H/Cam/aj "This is nice. You and me, all coupled up. I don't think it could get any better."
# s3_mc "I can think of one thing that would make it better‚Ä¶"
# B/H/Cam/aj "Oh really? And what would that be?"
# Choiceseb "Hmm, what would make this moment even better?"
# -A kiss
# You lean closer.
# B/H/Cam/aj "Oh, you mean‚Ä¶"
# Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ smiles seductively and pulls you closer. His/Her lips press firmly against yours.
# The kiss starts gently but builds in intensity. (B&H)
# His kisses move towards your collar bone, sending tingles down your spine. (B&H)
# You feel his/her tongue trace your lips and then he/she gently bites your bottom lip.(Cam&AJ)
# Cam/aj "I could eat you. (You get üòç with Camilo/AJ)"
# He/She nibbles down your neck, making you giggle. (Cam&AJ)
# You pull away, a little breathless.
# s3_mc "We're going to wake everyone up."
# B/H/Cam/aj "Good.They should be up anyway."

# -A cuddle
# You roll over, facing away from him/her. Then start to wiggle backwards until your body is nuzzled into him/her.
# B/H/Cam/aj "Woah, what are you doing?"
# s3_mc "Being the little spoon."
# You take Bill's/Harry's/Camilo's/AJ's arms and pull them in tight around your waist.
# s3_mc "Morning cuddles are the best."
# He/She rests his/her chin on your shoulder.
# You feel his/her body envelop yours. It's warm and reassuring.
# B/H/Cam/aj "Hmm, I could get used to this. (You get üòç with Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ)"

# -A cuppa
# You beckon Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ closer with your finger. He/She smiles and leans in.
# s3_mc "What I'd really love‚Ä¶"
# B/H/Cam/aj "Yeah‚Ä¶"
# s3_mc "It's a nice, hot, sweet‚Ä¶"
# s3_mc "‚Ä¶cup of tea."
# B/H/Cam/aj "Oh. You want a cuppa."
# B/H/Cam/aj "Actually, I could really go for one too."

# As Genevieve emerges and switches the lights on, Seb puts a pillow over his head and groans.
# seb "Ugh, turn it off!"
# genevieve "You're awake already! Your body clock says it's time to get up."
# seb "Can I put my body clock on snooze?"
# seb "I just need another hour. I'm knackered."
# nicky "Come on man! Today's the best day ever."
# (MC coupled with Bill/Harry/Camilo):
# Seb shivers and looks over at AJ who has taken all the sheets. 
# seb "You didn't have to wrestle AJ for a sliver of duvet."
# AJ stirs and Seb takes the opportunity to steal some back.
# aj "Hey!"
# AJ sits up sleepily.
# aj "Might as well get up then."
# nicky "C'mon, it's the furthest we're going to be from another recoupling."
# s3_mc "Nicky's got a point. That's worth celebrating."
# seb "Fair point."
# Seb jumps out of the bed and the Islanders cheer.
# seb "Time to seize the day."
# AJ jumps up with a smile and starts jogging on the spot.
# aj "Yes! That's the Seb I've been waiting for!"
# aj "What do you say? A couple of laps and then we hit the gym?"
# seb "Er, maybe after brekkie. You get a head start and I'll join you."
# AJ smiles brightly and bounds into the dressing room.
# nicky "You're going to hit the gym?"
# seb "No way. But have you tried to say no to AJ?"
# seb "I just haven't got the energy."
# camilo "The name of Seb's sex tape."
# Seb looks over at you and AJ before covering his face with the duvet.
# seb "Unless you missed it, my night didn't end so well."
# s3_mc "C'mon Seb, remember our chat? The Villa's your oyster now!"
# seb "Can't stand oysters. They're like giant bogies in shells."
# (Depending on who you told Seb to pursue; Elladine missing):
# Miki/Iona sits up and throws a pillow at Seb. He smiles.
# M/iona "Wow, a smile. I must have the magic touch."
# Seb glances in your direction and you give him a wink.
# thought "Was she flirting?"
# thought "I may have actually given Seb some good advice."
# genevieve "Right, misery guts. I am putting a smile on that face today even if I have to draw it on."
# seb "You won't be able to. I'm notoriously sour faced. Ask my mum."
# genevieve "Well, Seb's mum, prepare to be amazed."
# A smile touches the corner of his lips and he shoots you a knowing look.
# thought "Viv definitely brings out his softer side."
# thought "They'd make a lovely couple."
# Camilo jumps out of bed and stretches.
# camilo "Ain't gonna lie, we're all set for a sexy day."
# Bill claps his hands together with a grin.
# bill "Come on girls, time to get all leathery in the sun."
# (MC coupled with Bill/Harry/Camilo):
# Miki/Genevieve/Iona chucks a pillow at Bill and it hits him square in the face.
# bill "Someone woke up in a mood."
# M/G/iona "Actually, I feel great."
# M/G/iona "It's nice having the whole bed to yourself."
# miki "Especially after sharing a bed with that human starfish‚Ä¶"
# bill "You could've asked me for more space‚Ä¶"
# genevieve "No more being woken up at the crack of dawn."
# harry "You said you didn't even notice when I got up!"
# iona "It beats being almost pushed off the bed."
# camilo "I can't help it if I'm a cuddler."
# seb "Right, who's getting in the kitchen to cook me up some brekkie?"
# A flurry of pillows go flying towards Seb.
# seb "Fine. Cereal out the box it is."

# If you chose ‚Äúa kiss‚Äù or ‚Äúa cuddle‚Äù earlier:
# B/H/Cam/aj "Right, enough chit-chat. I'm off to get this one a morning beverage."

# Choiceseb "Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ is going to get me a drink. I want‚Ä¶"
# -A glass of bubbles
# B/H/Cam/aj "I could probably rustle you up a regular breakfast tea‚Ä¶"

# -A cuppa
# B/H/Cam/aj "I could probably rustle you up a regular breakfast tea‚Ä¶"

# -A matcha latte
# B/H/Cam/aj "I could probably rustle you up a regular breakfast tea‚Ä¶"

# If you chose ‚Äúa cuppa‚Äù earlier:
# B/H/Cam/aj "You still fancy that tea?"
# s3_mc "Is an elephant heavy?"
# B/H/Cam/aj "I'll get on it then."

# You jump out of bed.
# s3_mc "I'm coming with you."
# elladine "Aw, I am loving this. You two are such a couple already. No offence Miki/Genevieve/Iona/Seb."
# M/G/I/seb "Nah, it's proper cute."
# s3_mc "I just want to make sure he/she gets it just the way I like it."
# bill "I can make a cuppa."
# bill "My way's foolproof. First you need to‚Ä¶"
# harry "I'm from Yorkshire, we practically invented tea."
# s3_mc "Less talk, more tea!"
# camilo "That's sweet. I like having someone in the kitchen with me."
# camilo "And I wouldn't want to mess up your tea."
# bill "Make sure you unplug the toaster."
# nicky "I'll alert the fire brigade."
# s3_mc "Very funny."
# aj "That might not be a bad idea."
# s3_mc "But first I'm going to get changed. See you in the kitchen, babe."
# You bound off towards the dressing room.

# You quickly check yourself out in the mirror and tousle your hair.
# Choiceseb "I am looking good."
# -Blow yourself a kiss
# You blow your reflection a kiss.
# thought "Morning gorgeous."

# -Compliment your fine self
# thought "Damn girl. You are looking fine. Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ is one lucky Islander."

# -Spray your face with toner
# You close your eyes and spray the cool water onto your face.
# thought "So refreshing."

# thought "All I need now is a gorgeous outfit!"
# thought "Something that'll say to Bill/Harry/Camilo/aj "'you just levelled up, hun'.""
# MC outfit changes to swimwear
# thought "Looks good to me!"
# thought "Yup. This is definitely the ticket."

# thought "Meh, this will do I guess."
# thought "It's tea time!"
# "You never forget your first."
# "Mine was in a bed and breakfast in Dorset."
# "The sun was just coming up‚Ä¶"
# "Gold top milk, two sugar cubes‚Ä¶"
# "What did you lot think I was talking about? Mind in the gutter‚Ä¶"
# Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ is in the kitchen filling up the kettle.
# He/She spies you coming towards him/her.
# B/H/Cam/aj "There's my girl. Ready for your tea? (you get üòç with Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ)"
# s3_mc "Am I ever."
# He/She spies you coming towards him/her.
# B/H/Cam/aj "There's my girl, pretty as always. (you get üòç with Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ)"
# s3_mc "You're so sweet."
# s3_mc "And thirsty."
# B/H/Cam/aj "Oh really?"
# s3_mc "Where's this brew then?"
# B/H/Cam/aj "Oh, yeah. The tea."
# He/AJ spies you coming towards him/her and does a double take.
# B/H/Cam/aj "Wow. You are just‚Ä¶ wow.(you get üòç with Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ)"
# B/H/Cam/aj "I want to make you two cups of tea now."
# s3_mc "You're so sweet."
# s3_mc "And thirsty."
# B/H/Cam/aj "Oh really?"
# s3_mc "Where's this brew then?"
# B/H/Cam/aj "Oh, yeah. The tea."
# Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ grabs two mugs, sugar and the box of teabags. He/She puts the kettle on.
# s3_mc "You look so focused."
# B/H/Cam/aj "I'm trying to impress you aren't I?"
# Choiceseb "Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ wants to impress me‚Ä¶"
# -You don't need to impress me
# Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ turns and wraps his/her arms around your waist.
# B/H/Cam/aj "I know. But I really want to."
# s3_mc "That's really sweet, hun."
# s3_mc "I hope you're this keen to please all the time‚Ä¶"
# B/H/Cam/aj "You'll find out soon enough."

# -Tea isn't really impressive
# B/H/Cam/aj "Oh. Yeah. I mean, like, as a start."
# s3_mc "If tea's where this all starts, I'm not sure I want to see where it's going."
# B/H/Cam/aj "Wow, high maintenance, are you?"
# s3_mc "Let's just say it takes a lot to impress me."
# B/H/Cam/aj "Challenge accepted."

# -Buy me diamonds!
# Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ raises an eyebrow.
# B/H/Cam/aj "You want diamonds?"
# s3_mc "Ooh yeah, a big one. Princess cut."
# B/H/Cam/aj "A diamond ring‚Ä¶"
# s3_mc "Or a necklace. No! Wait! A tiara."
# B/H/Cam/aj "Let's start with the tea."

# The hiss of the kettle interrupts you both. Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ grabs the mugs.
# s3_mc "Now this is where it gets serious."
# s3_mc "You can tell a lot about a person from the way they like their tea."
# B/H/Cam/aj "Is that right now?"
# B/aj "Right, I've got a bit of a confession to make."
# s3_mc "You don't know how to make tea?"
# B/aj "I'm not that bad! Just, I'm more of a coffee drinker."
# He/She pops a teabag in the mug, adds a teaspoon of sugar and gives the cup a stir.
# After a few moments he/she removes the teabag and adds milk. (Bill/AJ)
# Harry pops in a spoon of sugar and a teabag, and fills the mug up halfway with hot water.
# He then tops it up with milk and takes out the teabag.
# He takes a sip of the milky drink.
# Camilo grabs the milk and pours a splash into a mug. He adds a teabag and tops it up with hot water.
# Choicelladine "The way you make a cup of tea is‚Ä¶"
# -Poetry in motion
# B/H/Cam/aj "It's not rocket science, just a teabag in a mug. (You get üôÇ with Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ)"
# s3_mc "I'll have mine just the same."
# B/H/Cam/aj "Coming right up."
# Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ makes you the tea with a silly smile plastered on his/her face.

# -A crime against humani-tea
# B/H/Cam/aj "What's wrong with how I make it?  (You get üôÅ with Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ)"
# s3_mc "Two teabags? Four sugars!"
# s3_mc "Milk first? Ugh."
# s3_mc "Let's just say you should stick to coffee, babe."
# s3_mc "The tea bag was only in the mug for two seconds!"
# s3_mc "I'll make my own."

# -Not very entertaining‚Ä¶
# B/H/Cam/aj "When is watching someone making tea entertaining? (You get üòÇ with Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ)"
# s3_mc "Sometimes there's a bit of showmanship."
# B/H/Cam/aj "Like what? Fireworks and a striptease?"
# s3_mc "That would have been entertaining."
# B/H/Cam/aj "What are you like."
# Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ slides you your tea.

# You both sip your cuppa.
# Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ glances at you over the rim of his/her mug. You see a smile touch the corner of his/her lips.
# B/H/Cam/aj "I could get used to starting my day like this."
# B/H/Cam/aj "Sexy girl in front of me, sipping a steamy beverage‚Ä¶"
# Choiceseb "Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ is flirting with me. I should‚Ä¶"
# -Get a cheeky snog in
# You step towards Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ and go in for a kiss.
# His/Her hands tighten around your waist. The faint taste of tea remains on his/her lips.
# B/H/Cam/aj "Yeah, I could definitely do this every morning."

# -Play it cool
# You take a sip of your tea and smile coyly.
# s3_mc "We'll see how it goes."

# -Flirt back
# s3_mc "This is great, but I can think of at least one thing that could top it."
# You run your fingers up Bill's/Harry's/Camilo's/AJ's arm and he/she bites his/her bottom lip.
# B/H/Cam/aj "Maybe we can start today again‚Ä¶"

# bff "Hey‚Ä¶"
# bff "You two weren't cracking on in the kitchen, were you?"
# Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ scratches the back of his/her neck and you carry on drinking your tea.
# s3_mc "Just enjoying some time alone."
# B/H/Cam/aj "Having a chat."
# bff "Well, we're over by the loungers for when you two are done doing whatever it is you're doing."
# BFF gives you a wink, grabs some fruit and heads out.
# s3_mc "Well, it was nice while it lasted."
# Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ smiles at you warmly. You both make your way to the loungers.
# You, Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ and the other Islanders are lounging by the pool. Your empty mug sits by your side. Laughter fills the air.

# "Bill's setting the world to rights and he's starting with vegetables."
# bill "And that's why you're better off using a cucumber."
# harry "Mate, I want to agree with you, but it just sounds disgusting."
# camilo "It's a risotto! Who puts cucumber in it?"
# "Well, I'm glad someone cleared that up for me‚Ä¶"
# iona "I don't know, they kinda do look exactly the same."
# bill "Exactly! Only a courgette is fanicer. A cucumber works just as well."
# camilo "Name of Bill's sex tape."
# The girls giggle and Bill just rolls his eyes.
# iona "If you were going to make a sex tape what would you actually call it?"
# nicky "Easy. True Grit."
# The Islanders groan and Elladine pulls a face of disgust.
# iona "How is that sexy?"
# nicky "It's not, I just think it's a great movie. Wait, you meant sex tape?"
# elladine "Mine would be something sensual‚Ä¶"
# She thinks for a moment, then says something in Welsh.
# miki "That's a bit of a mouthful, isn't it?"
# genevieve "Name of Miki's sex tape!"
# Camilo and Genevieve high five. Miki shakes her head, laughing.
# miki "What about you, MC? What would you name your naughty video?"
# The Islanders turn to you.
# Choiceseb "Hmm, my sex tape would be called‚Ä¶"
# -Inspect Her Gadget
# B/H/Cam/aj "You don't have to ask me twice‚Ä¶"
# elladine "MC, you're so dirty!"

# -Missionary Impossible
# camilo "Did you just came up with that?"
# s3_mc "What can I say, I'm a natural."

# -Sin-derella
# bill "If the shoe fits‚Ä¶"
# s3_mc "Very funny."

# -I wouldn't make one!
# seb "That's a crap name for a‚Ä¶ Oh, I see what you did there."
# B/H/Cam/aj "I get it, it's not for everybody."
# s3_mc "No judgement guys, just not my thing."
# Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ smiles and squeezes your hand.

# bill "Fast and Furious would be a good one too. You wouldn't even need to change the name."
# harry "I've actually driven one of those cars."
# iona "From the film? For real? That's so cool."
# harry "Yeah, normally you need special training, but I know my way around a car."
# bill "Yeah, all the way round to the passenger side."
# The Islanders all laugh, except for Harry who sits up.
# harry "I do, actually. They said I was a natural."
# bill "Yeah, course. Next thing he'll be saying is he was Arnie's stunt double in Expendables 2."
# bill "What did you do after? Go on a date with Zendaya? Regular James Bond this one."
# The Islanders laugh playfully.
# Harry frowns, and his jaw tightens. It's clear the vibe has changed.
# thought "Harry doesn't look like he's finding this funny."
# thought "I should decide if I want to be around this conversation."
# Choiceseb "Shall I get involved?"
# -I'll say something
# Choiceseb "Hmm, what shall I say?"
# -Tell Bill to stop
# s3_mc "Give it a rest, Bill."
# bill "What? He was the one who brought it up."

# -Ask if Harry's OK
# You catch Harry's eye and mouth 'Are you OK'?
# He forces a smile and nods.
# thought "Bill's still talking‚Ä¶"

# -Change the subject
# s3_mc "You know what's a good film? Any film with Ryan Gosling."
# iona "I would. He is so fit."
# bill "Yeah, Drive was awesome. Did you have a go on that car too, Harry?"

# Harry folds his arms and lies back down.
# bill "Sorry, mate, I was just playing around. Tell us about the car then."
# Harry inhales deeply, still frowning.
# harry "No thanks."
# seb "C'mon mate, what was it like? Fast or furious?"
# Harry shakes his head stubbornly.
# bill "Mate, there's no need to be weird about it, it was just a‚Ä¶"
# Harry jumps up.
# bill "What are you doing, mate?"
# harry "Everyone needs to stop talking to me."
# Harry strides towards the pool and dives in.
# s3_mc "Woah!"
# bill "My hair!"
# You watch as Harry resurfaces. He walks back slowly, looking more relaxed, and lies down on a lounger.
# Choiceseb "That's one way of ending a discussion‚Ä¶"
# -Lie back and enjoy the sun
# bill "I'm not trying to be funny or anything, but what just happened, mate?"

# -Ask what was that about
# s3_mc "Hey Harry, what just happened?"

# -Nudge Bill to say something
# bill "I'm not trying to be funny or anything, but what just happened, mate?"

# aj "Harry literally just jumped into the‚Ä¶"
# bill "We know what literally happened, AJ."
# harry "I'm sorry. I've always had a short temper. Ever since I was a kid."
# harry "You wouldn't think it, but I was always getting into fights."
# iona "I know plenty of folk who've got anger management issues."
# harry "Yeah, I guess you could call it that. I've been getting therapy for it though."
# harry "I don't lose it with anyone anymore, but sometimes the littlest thing can set me off."
# aj "And so‚Ä¶ you jump in the pool?"
# Choiceseb "Harry jumped into the pool because he was angry‚Ä¶"
# -I don't get it
# s3_mc "I mean, why jump in the pool?"

# -I totally get it
# s3_mc "It cools you off, right?"
# harry "Something like that."

# -What happens if there's no pool?
# s3_mc "I mean do you just go all Hulk?"

# Harry exhales.
# harry "It doesn't have to be a pool. Sometimes I just splash my face with water."
# harry "It's something we came up with in therapy."
# genevieve "It's a distraction thing, right?"
# harry "Yeah! Sort of."
# harry "Your body temperature goes up when you get angry, so you're literally cooling yourself down."
# Harry smiles, then turns back to Bill.
# harry "I know you were kidding. The anger just builds up sometimes. I feel like a right doughnut."
# bill "I didn't mean to upset you, mate. I was genuinely just messing about."
# seb "You're not a doughnut. You've found your own way of coping with a really tricky emotion."
# seb "That's really cool."
# harry "Yeah, therapy helped me out. Big time."
# bill "I'm glad to hear it, mate. I'm sorry again."
# harry "I know. I'm fine now, don't worry about it."
# Bill gets up and walks over to the pool edge.
# He grins at Harry and then flops into the pool.
# miki "Bill! My hair! You've soaked me completely!"
# Harry looks surprised as Bill pulls himself out of the pool and comes to sit by his side.
# harry "What did you go and do that for?"
# bill "You said you felt like a doughnut. That makes two of us now."
# bill "Two wet doughnuts."
# Harry grins and Bill messes up his hair.
# Choiceseb "Bill jumped in the pool to make Harry feel better‚Ä¶"
# -That makes no sense
# thought "Who even understands these boys?"

# -That was really sweet
# thought "He cares about his mates."
# Bill catches you looking at him and smiles.

# -Now they're both wet and it's kinda hot
# You bite your bottom lip and stare. Bill and Harry notice.
# harry "You alright there, MC?"
# s3_mc "Er, yeah, fine. I might jump in the pool myself."

# Another splash rings out. AJ and Camilo have dived into the pool.

# -I'd rather go and grab a snack
# You head to the kitchen and pick out a selection of fruit.
# Bearing a huge bowl, you emerge to see the other Islanders splashing around in the pool.
# Harry seems to have relaxed.

# aj "MC! Jump in!"
# camilo "Yeah, it's lovely. Good call Harry."
# Choiceseb "Should I jump into the pool?"
# -Move out of the way, here comes the cannon ball
# You take a running jump towards the pool.
# You tuck in your limbs and hit the water with an enormous splash.

# -I can't‚Ä¶My hair!
# genevieve "Well, if you won't I will."
# Genevieve whoops and jumps into the pool, splashing Miki.

# miki "You have got to be kidding me."
# You look over and see Harry and Bill grinning.
# miki "Right, I might as well get in now. I'm already wet."
# miki "Wait! That could be the name of my sex tape!"
# camilo "Yes, Miki! You nailed it."
# harry "And that can be the name of yours, Camilo."
# You climb out of the pool and dry off.
# thought "My shoulders are a bit stiff, I could do with a workout‚Ä¶"
# thought "And it would give me a chance for some good old-fashioned grafting."
# Choiceseb "Who shall I invite to the gym?"
# -Bill
# -Camilo
# -Harry
# -AJ

# s3_mc "Hey, Bill/Camilo/Harry/AJ, fancy a workout?"
# Bill/Camilo/Harry/AJ gives you a flirty look.
# B/H/Cam/aj "You know it."
# thought "Time to work up a sweat!"
# The breeze caresses your skins as you watch Bill/Camilo/Harry/AJ straddle the lat pulldown machine.

# B/H/Cam/aj "I always love getting my heart going on one of these. How about you?"
# Choiceseb "Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ wants to know if I train‚Ä¶"
# -Of course I do
# s3_mc "I love to break a sweat."
# B/H/Cam/aj "Nothing hotter than someone who trains."

# -It's not really my thing
# B/H/Cam/aj "Then I'll show you the ropes."
# B/H/Cam/aj "Er, not that we're doing anything with ropes today."

# B/H/Cam/aj "I'll get a firm grip on these handles‚Ä¶"
# thought "Hmm, that looks pretty heavy‚Ä¶"
# He/She pulls down towards his chest.
# s3_mc "Are you sure that's not too much weight?"
# B/H/Cam/aj "Hey, don't you worry about me."
# Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ pulls and there is little movement. He/She tries again.

# B/H/Cam/aj "Maybe a bit‚Ä¶"
# B/H/Cam/aj "I can do it!"
# Bill/Harry/Camilo tries again to no avail. He/She stops and has a look at the weight.
# B/H/Cam/aj "Who was last on this? The Rock?"
# (MC is a pro athlete):
# s3_mc "Me!"
# B/H/Cam/aj "Woah‚Ä¶ you're something else."
# (MC is not a pro athlete):
# s3_mc "I think it was Iona‚Ä¶"
# B/H/camilo "Woah. Does she put the pylons up by hand?"
# Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ rubs his/her shoulder.
# s3_mc "Is your shoulder sore?"
# B/H/Cam/aj "A little bit."

# Choiceseb "Do I really want to let it got?"

# -Take him/her to Viv to be checked out 
# s3_mc "If you're sore, Viv should take a look at you."
# B/H/Cam/aj "Good idea. I don't want to get achey."
# You both stand up and head towards the pool.

# Gem choice:

# He/She stretches luxuriously, looking like a very happy cat.
# Then he/she sighs.
# (Only Bill if you stayed earlier at the pool for the chat)
# bill "I feel bad about what happened with Harry."
# bill "I was just having a laugh. I didn't know he'd take it so personal."

# -Be critical
# s3_mc "Just don't do it again."
# bill "He's a top lad. I was just having a laugh."
# bill "Trust me, I won't tease him again. Not now I know."

# -Focus on the massage
# You let your hands do the talking. Bill gives a happier sigh.

# (Only Harry if you stayed earlier at the pool for the chat)

# s3_mc "Hey, you're among friends. We understand. Don't overthink this."
# Harry wipes his eyes and takes a deep breath before turning to face you.

# -Focus on the massage
# You let your hands do the talking. Harry wipes his eyes and gives a happier sigh.


# thought "He's/She's obviously enjoying this a lot!"
# You carry on kneading Bill's/Harry's/Camilo's/AJ's shoulders.
# Choiceseb "I should‚Ä¶"
# -Move into a head massage
# You slide your hands up his/her neck and as he/she moans with pleasure, you work your fingers into his/her hair.

# -Slide my hands down to his/her lower back
# Goosebumpbs appear on his/her shoulders as you work your way down his/her back.
# He/She moans with delight as you work your fingertips into his/her hips.

# -Stick to the shoulder
# You keep kneading his/her shoulders. Your fingers work their way down his/her strong arms.
# You feel his/her skin break out in goosebumps as he/she exhales deeply.

# s3_mc "Does that feel good?"
# B/H/Cam/aj "So good."
# Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ turns around, a mischievous look in his/her eyes.
# B/H/Cam/aj "If this was some master plan to get me right where you want me, mm‚Ä¶"
# B/H/Cam/aj "Well done."
# s3_mc "Oh really?"
# B/H/Cam/aj "You can run your hands all over me, if you want."

# Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ bites his bottom lip and looks at you hungrily. 
# B/H/camilo "Like a brand new man."
# aj "Like a brand new woman."
# He/She leans closer until the tips of your noses touch. His/Her hands rest firmly on your hips.
# B/H/Cam/aj "Have I told you how fit you are?"
# s3_mc "Tell me again‚Ä¶"
# He/She grimaces suddenly.
# s3_mc "You alright?"
# B/H/Cam/aj "My shoulder's still aching‚Ä¶"
# s3_mc "OK, I insist we go and find Genevieve."
# Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ groans.
# B/H/Cam/aj "OK‚Ä¶"
# You stand up to go. Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ coils an arm around your waist and you head over to the pool.

# (if you didn't take the gem choice to give a massage):
# "Oh MC, Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ thought his/her luck was in‚Ä¶"
# "Don't worry Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ. Things sound like they'll be heating up in the challenge‚Ä¶"
# (if you took the gem choice to give a massage):

# "Welcome back to Love Land! The best theme park in this hemisphere."
# "Our feature attraction is Bill/Harry/Camillo/AJ, The Ride."
# "Which MC is having a lot of fun on right now."
# "Did I just do that whole bit for the sake of a pun? You're damn right I did."
# "Previously on Love Island‚Ä¶"
# "Things got a little heated when Bill did a Bill‚Ä¶"
# harry "Normally you need a special training, but I know my way around a car."
# bill "Yeah, all the way round to the passenger side."
# "And did we have a special guest in the Villa?"
# B/H/Cam/aj "Who was last on this machine? The Rock?"
# "Sadly not. But I do have a pet rock to keep me company during the long, dark nights here."
# "I call him 'Rocky' in honour of Bill's favourite film franchise."
# "Coming up! "
# "Iona shouts about her job a lot."
# iona "I rig pylons!"
# "And innuendos are abound as our Islanders all pitch in for today's in-tents challenge."
# B/H/Cam/aj "My rod's so stiff."
# aj "I just can't find the hole!"
# "Strap yourselves in! This is one rollercoaster you don't want to miss."
# "Sun's out, birds are singing, and our Islanders‚Ä¶"
# "‚Ä¶are in the lounge."
# "I don't know why we even flew them out here. Next time we'll send them to Skegness."
# You lie sprawled across a sofa, your head resting on Bill's/Harry's/Camilo's/AJ's lap.
# Iona fans herself with a palm leaf.
# miki "It's nice to get out of the heat for a while."
# camilo "Yeah, bruv. It's an oven out there‚Ä¶"
# iona "It's an oven in here!"
# B/H/Cam/aj "Nah, that's just MC.I mean, have you seen how hot she is?"
# s3_mc "Bill!/Harry!/Camilo!/AJ!"
# B/H/Cam/aj "Don't even try and deny it."
# iona "Pack it in, you two. I don't think I can take any more."
# B/H/Cam/aj "Nah, that's just MC. I mean, have you seen her outfit today?"
# s3_mc "You already said that earlier, babe."
# B/H/Cam/aj "And?"
# iona "Pack it in, you two. I don't think I can take any more."
# harry "This is nothing. One time, my flat's boiler went on the blink and set itself to forty degrees!"
# harry "My ice lolly melted all over my head‚Ä¶"
# Choiceseb "You think this is hot? I once‚Ä¶"
# -Got stranded in Death Valley
# s3_mc "Our car broke down in the middle of it. We were stuck there for half a day!"
# bill "Why were you even out there?"
# s3_mc "To sightsee! But like, there's nothing there. Just heat."
# nicky "It's meant to be pretty, tough, right?"
# s3_mc "Sure, if you like beige‚Ä¶"
# bill "That's a solid colour, to be fair."

# -Sat next to Tessa Thompson
# AJ lets out a squeal.
# aj "What?"
# aj "I would have been a mess!"
# nicky "She's proper cute, man."
# s3_mc "Even cuter in person."
# aj "I would give anything to just, like, touch her face."
# aj "Not for long or anything. Just like‚Ä¶"
# aj "‚Ä¶boop."

# -Was in a lift with Jason Momoa
# Iona's breath catches in her throat.
# iona "Shut up! No way!"
# s3_mc "Yeah way. He's‚Ä¶ impressive."
# iona "That's an understatement."
# iona "Ugh, I'd let him blast me with his trident any day."
# genevieve "Oh my gosh, Iona."

# -Looked in a mirror
# B/H/Cam/aj "You're not wrong!"
# iona "I love the confidence you have, babe."

# The others laugh.
# nicky "Tell you what, this one time during a heatwave, an ex's cat hid this box of prawns we'd just bought."
# nicky "The next day we were tearing the place apart looking for what was causing the smell!"
# nicky "She even put my shoes outside."
# Choiceseb "Are we seriously talking about your ex's prawns‚Ä¶?"
# -Can we change the subject?
# -I mean, it's funny, keep going
# s3_mc "It's just weird is all‚Ä¶"
# nicky "Right so, we've looked everywhere. Changed the litter box. Bleached all the drains and all this. (you get üòç with Nicky)"
# nicky "And it still honks."
# nicky "We're knackered by now, so we crash down onto the sofa‚Ä¶"
# nicky "‚Ä¶ and a prawn slides out from under a cushion."
# s3_mc "What?"
# nicky "The little bugger had hid the box under our sofa cushion."

# -Tell me more about this cat‚Ä¶
# nicky "He was a proper terror. (you get üôÑ with Nicky)"
# nicky "Adorable. But, like, a demon."
# nicky "This fluffy white thing whose favourite game was jumping on my head from a height‚Ä¶"
# nicky "Turns out he'd hidden the prawns under the sofa cushions."

# nicky "It took two boil washes to stop the fabric smelling like Billingsgate fish market‚Ä¶"
# seb "That's cats for you, man."
# "There's something fishy about that story."
# "But we won't get to the bottom of it now. It's challenge time!"
# miki "Oh, I got a text."
# Text: Islanders, please make your way to the lawn for today's challenge. #someassemblyrequired #mightyerections
# genevieve "I wonder what it is?"
# Camilo looks out of the window.
# camilo "What're all those bundles on the lawn?"
# "In today's challenge, our girls have to help the lads pitch a tent."
# "No, not like that‚Ä¶"
# "An actual tent."
# "You lot are filthy."
# All across the lawn are bundles of nylon, tent pegs, and collapsed metal poles.
# s3_mc "I've got a text."
# Text: Islanders, it's time to find out how good you are with your hands in today's pitch a tent challenge. The couple with the best tent, as voted by the others, get to decide what everyone eats tonight. #tentlife #grabapole #canvastheneighbourhood
# harry "Aw, man. I've never put up a proper tent. Even when I got to Glasto, I just use a pop up‚Ä¶"
# seb "Pop ups all the way, man. Tents are a faff."
# genevieve "We always get medical crew tents at festivals. I've never put one up before‚Ä¶"
# iona "Pfft. I rig pylons for a living, which are basically just big tents."
# elladine "They are?"
# iona "Well, no, but they're mostly wires and poles and stuff. This'll be a cinch."
# camilo "This is gonna be a huge pain."
# bill "Just follow the instructions, mate. It's simple."
# aj "Yeah! I used to put tents up in the Brownies all the time. It's really not that hard."
# Choiceseb "Can I put up a tent?"
# -We've got this!
# B/aj "You know it, babe!"
# H/camilo "I hope that means you're good at this‚Ä¶"

# -We're doomed (MC coupled with Camilo is missing)
# B/aj "Nah, I believe in you, babe. I'll be here to help, too!"
# harry "Don't say that! Let's at least give it a go‚Ä¶"

# -I care more about what we do in the tent‚Ä¶
# B/H/Cam/aj "You and me both‚Ä¶ (you get üòè with Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ)"

# elladine "Alright, let's quit the nattering and get on with it then!"
# miki "Woah, Elladine's got a competitive side."
# elladine "It's a task that needs completing. Nicky, grab those poles, we're going to do this right."
# nicky "No problem, babe."
# He goes over to their bundle and picks it up.
# Something comes undone, and the poles and small metal rings clatter to the ground.
# nicky "We may now have a problem."
# You and Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ look down at your unassembled tent.
# B/aj "Right then, first things first."
# He/She scans through the instructions.
# B/aj "Seems simple enough."
# H/camilo "Right so‚Ä¶ how'd we do this?"
# s3_mc "We've got the instructions right here."
# He looks at them.
# H/camilo "I don't get this at all. It's like they're written in another language‚Ä¶"
# s3_mc "They're pictures?"
# H/camilo "Confusing pictures. But, I think I see what we need to do first‚Ä¶"
# B/H/Cam/aj "We need to thread these rods through the, um, tenty bits."
# s3_mc "The holes?"
# B/H/Cam/aj "Yeah, tenty bits. "
# Choiceseb "We need to thread the poles through the tenty bits‚Ä¶"
# -Do as the instructions say
# You pick up one of the rods and assemble it, then carefully slide it through one of the tent holes.
# B/aj "Nice one. You've done this before."
# Bill/AJ does the same.
# B/aj "People get themselves in a right mess putting up a tent. I've never understood why. It's pretty straightforward."
# H/camilo "Wow, you really seem to know what you're doing, babe."
# He stands and watches you.
# H/camilo "Keep at it!"

# -Do a sexy dance with the pole (MC coupled with Harry/Camilo is missing)
# You wedge one of the poles into the ground and start to twirl around it, kicking a leg up and arching your back down.
# B/H/Cam/aj "This isn't distracting or anything‚Ä¶"
# As you pull yourself back up, you lean too heavily on the pole. It snaps in half.
# B/H/camilo "Nice one, babe!"
# s3_mc "Whoops‚Ä¶"
# thought "Maybe not the best idea."
# thought "But who cares? I had fun."
# B/aj "Alright, step aside."

# -Cocoon yourself in the nylon
# You toss your rod aside and scoop up the nylon tent.
# B/H/Cam/aj "What are you‚Ä¶?"
# Before Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ can say anymore, you wrap yourself in the material until only your face is poking out.
# B/H/Cam/aj "Oh."
# B/aj "Anyway, you've had your fun‚Ä¶"
# B/aj "Can I have the tent back?"
# H/camilo "Why doesn't everyone use tents like that?"
# H/camilo "Stops us having to put them up at least!"
# He looks around at the others.
# H/camilo "Although‚Ä¶"
# B/H/Cam/aj "We need to actually put it up."
# s3_mc "But I'm a tent burrito!"
# B/H/Cam/aj "Aw, you're very cute, but come on. Unwrap yourself."
# Pouting, you slip out of the fabric.
# B/H/Cam/aj "We're getting nowhere with this‚Ä¶"

# Bill/Harry/Camilo picks up another pole, but struggles to put it together.
# B/H/camilo "My rod's so stiff."
# Choiceseb "Bill/Harry/Camilo just said his rod is stiff‚Ä¶"
# -Roll your eyes
# -That better be true later
# B/H/camilo "Oh, don't you worry."

# -Give it a good tug
# B/H/camilo "I'm tugging as hard as I can!"
# B/H/camilo "It's not been oiled well enough."

# -Need a hand?
# B/H/camilo "Yeah. You pull that end while I tug on this one."
# B/H/camilo "You should feel when it's about to give‚Ä¶"

# Eventually the pole loosens and he threads it into place.

# AJ goes to thread the last rod through its eyelet, but keeps losing track of where it is.
# aj "I can't find the hole!"
# Choiceseb "AJ says she can't find the hole‚Ä¶"
# -Roll your eyes
# -That's what she said
# aj "Who? Has someone else figured out how to do it?"
# She looks round at the other Islanders.
# s3_mc "Not quite what I meant."
# aj "Oh! I see."
# aj "Good one."

# -Explore it with your fingertips
# aj "How will that help? I've already‚Ä¶"
# aj "‚Ä¶Oh!"
# aj "Those kind of jokes always go over my head."

# Eventually, she manages to find the eyelet and slips the rod through it.

# You look around at the others.
# (if you chose ‚ÄúDo as the instruction says‚Äù):
# You and Bill/AJ seem to be smashing it. The others are nowhere near finished.
# thought "We've got this in the bag."
# You and Harry's/Camilo's is the most complete, with Elladine and Nicky close behind.
# thought "Ours can still be better."
# (If you chose ‚ÄúDo a sexy dance with the pole‚Äù or ‚ÄúCocoon yourself in the nylon‚Äù):
# You and Camilo/Harry/Bill are lagging behind the others, who all have their tents up and in pretty good shape.
# Except Iona's.
# Iona kneels on the lawn, swaddled in a mass of rope.
# iona "Wait! I've done this the wrong way round‚Ä¶"
# iona "‚Ä¶I think?"
# iona "Or maybe it's fine? I can't tell! How are these instructions so impossible to follow?"
# iona "I rig pylons!"
# (MC coupled with Harry/Bill/AJ):
# camilo "Um, babe, are you OK?"
# You look over to see Iona's hands tied together in the rope.
# iona "I don't know how this has happened. This stuff's so fiddly."
# Camilo looks over at her and rolls his eyes, then looks back to the instructions.
# iona "Camilo, babe, as much as I want to be tied up with you, could you maybe help me out."
# camilo "Oh! Sorry. You just seemed like you had it in hand, you know?"
# iona "I do have it! Putting up tents isn't difficult. I've just gotten tangled up somehow."
# Elladine's voice rings out across the lawn.
# elladine "Nicky, come and hold this corner while I set the pegs."
# nicky "Why?"
# elladine "I don't want the wind to take the tent away. Come quickly!"
# nicky "There's no wind, though?"
# Just a large gust starts to lift their tent.
# elladine "Quick, hurry!"
# Choiceseb "Next we need to hammer the pegs in‚Ä¶"
# -Hulk out and smash them!
# s3_mc "MC smash!"
# You raise the rubber mallet high in the air before bringing it crashing down onto one of the pegs.
# It goes straight into the ground without any resistance.
# B/H/Cam/aj "Woah‚Ä¶"
# You continue your rampage, you start to hit the ground, or sometimes the tent, and a few pegs are bent under the force.
# B/aj "Um, how about I do the rest?"
# s3_mc "No, I've got this!"
# You don't have this.
# One of the pegs gives way, and the tent sags sideways.
# s3_mc "Whoops‚Ä¶"
# B/aj "It's all good, babe. It's kind of like, art now, or something."
# H/camilo "Harry/Camilo smash, too!"
# He joins you in smashing down the pegs. Some bend, but enough seem to survive.

# -Ask Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ to do it
# s3_mc "Ugh, babe, this is hard."
# s3_mc "Could, you, like, to the rest?"
# B/H/Cam/aj "I‚Ä¶"
# s3_mc "Pleeease‚Ä¶"
# B/aj "Why can't you do it? "
# s3_mc "My fingers ache."
# s3_mc "It's an actual thing."
# B/aj "I'll do it for now, but I'm not going to be a pushover for you all the time."
# He/she goes around the tent and has it pegged down in no time.
# H/camilo "And you can't help because‚Ä¶?"
# s3_mc "I just want to watch you use those big muscles of yours."
# H/camilo "‚Ä¶Fair."
# He uses his big muscles a bit too effectively. By the time he's done, most of the tent pegs are bent.
# H/camilo "Oops‚Ä¶"

# -Say something dirty‚Ä¶
# s3_mc "This tent won't be the only thing getting nailed if I'm lucky‚Ä¶"
# Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ looks at you confused.
# B/H/Cam/aj "I don't get it?"
# s3_mc "Oh, don't worry‚Ä¶"
# s3_mc "‚Ä¶you will."

# Choiceseb "Right, the pegs are in. Me and Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ put up a tent together!"
# -Pretend to give him/her the keys to your first home
# s3_mc "Hey, babe‚Ä¶"
# B/H/Cam/aj "Yeah?"
# You pick up a small pebble and walk up to Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ.
# s3_mc "Hold out your hand and close your eyes."
# B/H/Cam/aj "OK‚Ä¶"
# He/She does what you say. You drop the pebble into his/her outstretched palm.
# Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ frowns and opens their eyes.
# B/H/Cam/aj "What's this?"
# s3_mc "The keys to our first home‚Ä¶"
# Bill looks at the tent. (you get ü•∞ with Bill)
# bill "Oh, man. We really fluffed it on that mortgage deal, eh?"
# He turns to you.
# bill "Still, any place with you would be a cracking home‚Ä¶"
# harry "Though I always thought my first home would be a little bigger, you know? (you get ü•∞ with Harry)"
# harry "I guess it at least has a pool."
# harry "But no garage for my sports car."
# camilo "Woah, you're saying I'm a homeowner already? (you get ü•∞ with Camilo)"
# camilo "It's a bit small to fit my family in as well, though‚Ä¶"
# s3_mc "Huh?"
# camilo "Relax, I'm just joshing you."
# aj "But it's a tent? (you get ü•∞ with AJ)"
# s3_mc "It's symbolism, babe!"
# aj "Oooh!"
# aj "That's so sweet!"

# -Tell him/her to take his shoes off inside
# s3_mc "Hey, babe‚Ä¶"
# B/H/Cam/aj "Yeah?"
# s3_mc "Don't forget to remove your shoes before you go into the tent."
# Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ looks down at his feet.
# B/H/Cam/aj "I'm not wearing any?"
# s3_mc "Ah, but you might be later, and then you'd get dirt all over our nice tent."
# B/H/Cam/aj "I guess we did make it look pretty great‚Ä¶ (if you made a good tent)"
# B/H/Cam:aj "Um, have you seen our tent? (if you made a bad tent)"
# s3_mc "It's just a pet peeve of mine, OK. I like shoes off in a house."
# B/H/aj "It's a tent, but, I guess‚Ä¶"
# B/H/Cam/aj "‚Ä¶OK."

# -Whisper in his/her ear the naughty things you want to do in it
# s3_mc "Hey, babe‚Ä¶"
# B/H/Cam/aj "Yeah?"
# s3_mc "Come over here for a second‚Ä¶"
# Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ walks over. You lean close to his/her ear.
# Choiceseb "When we get into this tent‚Ä¶"
# -I'm going to nibble every inch of you
# Bill's/Harry's cheeks flush red.
# B/harry "That's a lot of me‚Ä¶"
# B/harry "Where would you even start?"
# Camilo/AJ bites her/her lips and grins at you. (You get üòè with Camilo/AJ)
# Cam/aj "Every inch, eh? Where would you start?"
# s3_mc "Wherever you'd want me to‚Ä¶"

# -I want you to tie me up with the rope
# Bill/Harry swallows hard.
# B/harry "Oh‚Ä¶? I mean, we have some rope going spare."
# A sly grin spreads across Camilo's/AJ's face. (you get üòè with Camilo/AJ)
# Cam/aj "Oh yeah? I think we have some rope going spare‚Ä¶"
# B/H/Cam/aj "I just better remember some decent knots."

# -We're going to get down to some serious canoodling‚Ä¶(MC coupled with Camilo/AJ is missing)
# B/harry "Canoodling? What does that mean?"
# B/harry "I mean, I'm not saying no or anything‚Ä¶"
# s3_mc "Like, kissing and stuff."
# B/harry "Oh, OK!"

# While the others are still finishing up around you, you stand back and look at your tent.
# (If you didn't make a good tent):
# s3_mc "Our tent looks really sad."
# B/H/Cam/aj "Yeah, we did a rubbish job of it‚Ä¶"
# thought "I think I can fix this. If I grab stuff from around the Villa, I can make the tent look amazing!"
# thought "Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ would love it."
# (If you made a good tent):
# s3_mc "Our tent looks amazing!"
# B/H/Cam/aj "Yeah, babe. We smashed it."
# thought "Hmm, it could be even better‚Ä¶"
# thought "I could go make it super sexy! We'd definitely win the challenge then, and Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ would love it‚Ä¶"
# Choiceseb "Should I go all out to make this tent look great?"
# -Yeah, make the tent look banging (gem choice)

# -Nah, it's fine as is‚Ä¶
# thought "There's some nice stuff around the Villa I could use to make it special."
# Choiceseb "I bet Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ would love it!"
# -I'm going to do it for him/her (gem choice)
# -It seems like effort‚Ä¶
# All around you, the other Islanders rush about, putting their final touches to their tents.
# Harry/Bill/Camilo/AJ whistles at the tent.
# (If you didn't make a good tent):
# B/H/Cam/aj "I'm not gonna lie. I'm worried about this tent falling down during the night."
# (if you followed the instructions):
# B/H/Cam/aj "Our tent is amazing, babe."
# A loud, metallic snap followed by a crash makes the two of you turn around.
# iona "Dammit! How'd that pole snap?"
# genevieve "Do you need help, hun?"
# iona "No!"
# camilo "Um, I think we do‚Ä¶"
# iona "But‚Ä¶"
# iona "I can riga  pylon! I don't need help with this!"
# nicky "You sure?"
# iona "‚Ä¶Fine. Help, please."
# The others go over and hold up her tent while she sets about taping together the pole.

# Gem choice:
# s3_mc "I've got an idea!"
# B/H/Cam/aj "Huh?"
# s3_mc "Just close your eyes, I'm going to do something fun."
# (if you choose to give him/her a pebble as the key to your home):
# B/H/Cam/aj "Again?"
# B/H/Cam/aj "You're not going to drop more rocks into my hand are you?"
# s3_mc "Just close them and don't open them until I say so! "
# B/H/Cam/aj "OK‚Ä¶"
# He/She closes his/her eyes.
# You crawl inside the tent.
# thought "As bad on the inside as it is on the outside‚Ä¶(If you didn't follow the instructions)"
# thought "Hmm, it definitely looks better on the outside than on the inside‚Ä¶(If you followed the instructions)"
# thought "Time to fix that!"
# thought "I think the lounge has a plush rug and some fluffy cushions‚Ä¶"
# You make your way there.
# On your way, you spot some fairy lights hanging from the kitchen ceiling.
# thought "They'd give the tent some nice mood lighting‚Ä¶"
# You start to take down the fairy lights when you hear a voice behind you.
# bff "Um, MC‚Ä¶what are you doing?"
# Choicelladine "Oh‚Ä¶this?"
# -I need them for sex!
# -I'm making our tent look lush
# s3_mc "I want to make it look super cosy for Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ."
# bff "'Cosy', eh? (you get ü•∞ with BFF)"

# -It isn't what it looks like
# bff "Oh really? Because it looks like you're taking a string of fairy lights."
# s3_mc "Hmm‚Ä¶ I guess it's exactly how it looks, then."
# s3_mc "I want to use them to make my tent cosier‚Ä¶"
# bff "'Cosy', eh? "

# elladine "So to achieve the best mood lightning, I suggest you zig-zag these across the top of the tent."
# elladine "Set up mirrors around it, too. That way, they'll catch the light and be a good stand in for candles."
# s3_mc "How do you know this?"
# elladine "I'm an artist, hun. I have an eye for aesthetics, yeah?"
# elladine "And do you not think I know how to get some sexy mood light going?"

# genevieve "Oh! You could drape some colourful sheets around them. It'll dim the light and make the tent a funky colour."
# genevieve "I've seen people at festivals do all kinds of fun stuff to decorate their tents."
# genevieve "Do you think we can find a smoke machine lying around here at all?"
# s3_mc "No?"
# genevieve "Shame‚Ä¶what about a bubble one?"

# seb "This is weird."
# s3_mc "‚Ä¶"
# seb "But I like weird, so let me help."

# nicky "Say no more. I'm all up for helping you score."
# s3_mc "Nicky!"
# nicky "What?"
# s3_mc "You're just so blunt."
# nicky "Only way to be."

# You and BFF take down the fairy lights. She/He then helps you lug some fluffy pillows and the plush rug from the lounge to your tent.
# You pass Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ who still has his/her eyes closed.
# B/H/Cam/aj "Is that you, babe? Can I open my eyes yet?"
# s3_mc "No! It's still a surprise."
# B/H/Cam/aj "Aww‚Ä¶"
# Before you know it, you have the nicest tent out of everyone.
# bff "Woah, now I'm jealous. Can we all just cram in here?"
# s3_mc "Nope!"
# bff "Hmph, fair."
# BFF looks out of the tent towards Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ, who's still standing there with closed eyes.
# bff "Well, looks like it's time for me to leave."
# bff "You two have some‚Ä¶ cosiness to get up to."
# BFF winks at you before slipping out of the tent.
# s3_mc "Babe! You can come in now."
# Still covering his/her eyes, Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ finds his way into the tent.
# He/She kneels in front of the door.
# s3_mc "Alright, open your eyes."
# His/Her jaw drops as he/she removes his/her hand and looks around the tent.
# B/H/Cam/aj "What happened to the tent, babe? (you get üò≤ with Bill/Harry/Camilo /AJ)"
# Choiceseb "Oh, the tent?"
# -I thought we'd have a romantic night in
# s3_mc "And if it meant pinching a bunch of stuff from the Villa, so be it‚Ä¶"
# bill "I didn't realise you were so sappy! (you get üòç with Bill)"
# bill "I like it."
# harry "You've made this tent suddenly feel so much posher. (you get üòç with Harry)"
# harry "The perfect place for some romance‚Ä¶"
# camilo "This is legit one of the most romantic things anyone's ever done for me. (you get üòç with Camilo)"
# camilo "Whoever said romance is dead was so wrong."
# aj "I didn't think a tent could be 'sexy'. (you get üòç with AJ)"
# aj "Not that, like, the tent itself is sexy‚Ä¶"
# aj "As in, it creates a mood, kind of thing."
# She sighs.
# aj "You've done a fab job, babe."

# -You hate it don't you?(MC coupled with Harry/Camilo/AJ is missing)
# bill "Hate it?"
# bill "It's mint, babe! (you get üòç with Bill)"

# -Welcome to my den of sin‚Ä¶(MC coupled with Camilo is missing)
# bill "I'd say it's the best den I've ever been in."
# s3_mc "Have you been in many?"
# bill "This is my first. Which makes it the best by default."
# bill "But even if I'd been in many, this would still be the best."
# harry "I always wanted a den. (you get üòè with Harry)"
# harry "You know, like a room full of video games and an ultra-wide-screen TV and a popcorn machine."
# s3_mc "Ahem. Focus on the now?"
# harry "Oh yeah, sorry! This tent is amazing."
# aj "Agh! I wished I'd known this was going to happen. (you get üòè with AJ)"
# aj "I have this sexy devil Halloween costume back at home which would have been perfect‚Ä¶"

# s3_mc "I'm glad you like it."
# s3_mc "I wanted it to look good for you, babe."
# His/Her cheeks flush red. For a moment, the only sound you hear is Bill's/Harry's/ Camilo's/AJ's gentle breathing‚Ä¶
# Choiceseb "Should I kiss Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ?"
# -Go in for a kiss
# You lean past Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ towards the entrance of the tent and slowly pull and zipper shut.
# B/H/Cam/aj "Want to give us some privacy?"
# You don't say anything. Instead, you make your way over to Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ and take hold of his/her hand.
# He/She moves into your embrace and your lips meet.
# You gently bite down on Bill's/Harry's/Camilo's/AJ's bottom lip and feel a shudder course through his/her body. He/She pulls away.
# B/H/Cam/aj "I want you‚Ä¶"
# s3_mc "‚Ä¶"

# -Give him/her a hug
# You move across to Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ and wrap your arms around his/her waist.
# He/She puts his/her across your shoulders. As his/her arms envelope you, you can feel the warmth of his/her body against yours.
# You're still for a moment, just enjoying the closeness‚Ä¶
# You two stay there for a while, under the glow of the fairy lights, just enjoying each other's touch.
# B/H/Cam/aj "You're an amazing hugger‚Ä¶"
# s3_mc "And you're so warm!"
# B/H/Cam/aj "True. I'm pretty hot‚Ä¶"

# -Enjoy the silence
# You let out a deep breath and just enjoy the moment for what it is.
# The sound of gentle wind hitting the side of the tent becomes hypnotic.
# You're almost about to nod off when‚Ä¶

# A crash outside snaps you away from the moment.
# iona "Dammit! How'd that pole snap?"
# genevieve "Do you need help, hun?"
# iona "No!"
# camilo "Um, I think we do‚Ä¶ (MC coupled with Bill/Harry/AJ)"
# iona "But‚Ä¶ (MC coupled with Bill/Harry/AJ)"
# iona "I'm normally really good at stuff like this‚Ä¶"
# Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ laughs and turns back to you.
# B/H/Cam/aj "Hmm, it's a bit 'busy' outside."
# B/H/Cam/aj "Maybe later?"
# s3_mc "You'll have to wait and see‚Ä¶"
# You step out of the tent.
# You emerge from your tent to find the others holding Iona's tent up while she tapes a snapped pole back together.

# While the Islanders are busy putting up Iona's tent, BFF walks over to you.
# bff "This challenge has been a thing, eh?"
# s3_mc "Tell me about it."
# bff "Well, we can't really help Iona. Too many chefs and all that."
# bff "Guess the best thing we can do is stay out of the way."

# elladine "Hey, MC, could I ask you a quick question?"
# s3_mc "Sure, hun."
# elladine "Do you think I got a bit too much into this challenge?"
# elladine "Like, was I too bossy?"
# Choiceseb "Earlier you‚Ä¶"
# -Were a bit, yeah‚Ä¶
# -Needed to give Nicky a push!
# -Weren't bossy at all
# Elladine breathes a small sigh of relief.
# elladine "That's good to hear."

# s3_mc "Why do you ask?"
# She twiddles her thumbs.
# elladine "One of my exes once said he thought I was too bossy‚Ä¶"
# elladine "I'm fine speaking up for myself! I give instructions in the workshop all the time and I don't worry about it."
# elladine "But then when it comes to romance‚Ä¶ I worry Nicky might be put off like my ex was."
# elladine "Maybe I'm being silly‚Ä¶"
# Choiceseb "Elladine says that a guy didn't like her attitude‚Ä¶"
# -Girl, same. It's been an issue for me, too
# -Just for saying what you think?
# elladine "Yeah‚Ä¶ I mean the way I say it."
# elladine "Maybe they think I'm unkind? Or want me to change?"
# s3_mc "Woah, hold on!"
# s3_mc "If you were unkind, you wouldn't be this worried about other people, so that's not even on the table."
# s3_mc "And second, never change just so someone can like you!"
# s3_mc "You're great and any guy that's worth it will love you just the way you are."
# Elladine thinks for a moment.
# elladine "Yeah, you're right! (you get ü•∞ with Elladine)"
# elladine "Thanks, hun."

# -You're not bossy, you're the boss!
# s3_mc "If people have a problem with you telling it like it is, you just need to remember‚Ä¶"
# s3_mc "‚Ä¶it's them that has the problem!"
# elladine "Well, yeah! But that's easier said than done hun. (you get üôÅ with Elladine)"
# elladine "I will try, though. I don't want to keep driving people away over such a silly thing."
# s3_mc "It's not a silly thing. No one should make you feel you have to change your personality for them to like you!"

# elladine "Thanks for letting me vent‚Ä¶"
# elladine "Enough about me now, what's on your mind?"
# s3_mc "We should talk about‚Ä¶"
# -The big question. Would you live on Mars?
# -your biggest hopes and fears
# elladine "Go big or go home, eh, babe?"
# elladine "Well my biggest hope is to display my art in galleries all around the world."
# elladine "Installations that draw in thousands of people‚Ä¶"
# elladine "I guess my biggest fear is that I don't do the rigging correctly and all of those pieces fall to the ground and shatter‚Ä¶"
# She lets out a nervous chuckle.
# s3_mc "Is that really it?"
# elladine "Maybe, maybe not."
# elladine "Maybe, I'll tell you properly another time‚Ä¶"

# -This bossy side to you some more
# elladine "No, hun. (you get üôÅ with Elladine)"
# elladine "Thanks for checking, but I'm good."
# s3_mc "Sure?"
# elladine "Totes sure, you've done your free bit of therapy for the day!"

# She smiles at you.
# elladine "I really like having these chats with you, hun. It feels like I can leave the rest of the Villa behind for a couple of minutes."
# Choiceseb "I feel‚Ä¶"
# -Completely indifferent to them
# -Like we should just take the money and run
# -The same way about our chats
# elladine "I'm glad to hear it! (you get ü•∞ with Elladine)"
# elladine "They really do make me feel better."

# She sighs.


# genevieve "OK, so‚Ä¶"
# genevieve "I have this thing‚Ä¶"
# genevieve "Like, when you're on a night out, or camping in a field, or you're at a festival‚Ä¶"
# genevieve "Or you're in someone's house with abnormally long corridors and no working light‚Ä¶"
# genevieve "Basically anywhere that, like, might have a toilet in the dark‚Ä¶"
# She shudders.
# genevieve "Sorry, totally lost my train of thought there."
# genevieve "What was I on about?"
# s3_mc "The thing with toilets in the dark."
# genevieve "Oh, yeah!"
# genevieve "I always try and make sure I have at least one dedicated friend with me who I know will accompany me on the going-to-the-toilet mission."
# genevieve "I call them my Bathroom Babe."
# genevieve "I think out of everyone here, you'd definitely be my main Bathroom Babe."
# genevieve "You just seem like someone I can really count on."
# She looks down at her feet.
# genevieve "And I don't want to let something silly like boys get between us."
# genevieve "No matter who Harry ends up with, our friendship is solid."
# Choiceseb "Aw, babe‚Ä¶"
# -This was all so awkward
# -Boys smell
# -I hope you can forgive me
# s3_mc "I stole him from you‚Ä¶"
# genevieve "Nobody stole anything, and there's nothing to forgive."
# genevieve "That's literally how it works in here."
# genevieve "Besides, he wouldn't stop talking about you when we were together."
# genevieve "And who can blame him? You're amazing."
# genevieve "A true Bathroom Babe."
# genevieve "And that's with a capital 'B' because it's a very important title."
# Choiceseb "Genevieve wants me to be her Bathroom Babe!"
# -Yeah! Let's have a bath together
# genevieve "Noo, not bathroom bathe."
# genevieve "Bathroom Babe!"
# She laughs.
# bill "Though, now I'm imaging us sat in a bath sky high full of bubbles."
# genevieve "Sipping on wine and having a good soak."
# genevieve "Damn, that would be nice."

# -This is crucial, I hate going to the bathroom alone
# Genevieve puts a hand on your shoulder.
# genevieve "Girl."
# genevieve "You don't ever have to worry about that again."
# genevieve "I will go with you."

# -I didn't even know there was a bathroom thing
# genevieve "Wait, what?"
# genevieve "You haven't used the loo since we got here?"
# s3_mc "Nope!"
# genevieve "That's kinda concerning. I'd speak to a doctor about that."
# genevieve "Oh, wait. I am a doctor."
# genevieve "Well, it's a conflict of interest, because I'm your mate."
# genevieve "Though as your mate, my recommendation is for you to see a doctor about that."
# genevieve "But anyway‚Ä¶"

# genevieve "We'll always stick together when we go to the bathroom at night."
# genevieve "And when we're out of here, we could go to festivals, nights out, and maybe even go on camping trips together!"


# s3_mc "Oh, hey, by the way."
# s3_mc "How do you think Doom's doing?"
# seb "I'm trying not to think about her too much."
# seb "I know she's in safe hands, but I can't help worrying about her when I do."
# seb "It's weird to think she might've had her kittens already and I wouldn't even know."
# Choiceseb "You might go home to a lot more cats than you left behind‚Ä¶"
# -I wouldn't be looking forward to that
# -Are you sure you're ready to be a dad?
# He groans.
# seb "I don't know!"
# seb "It's scary. I really want to do right by them."
# Choiceseb "Just remember the most important thing.. (all get the same reaction)"
# -Get them into a good school
# -Train them to fetch the newspaper
# -Set up them up on socials
# seb "I will do my best."

# -You're so lucky! Could I adopt one?
# s3_mc "I'd love to have a new kitten in my life when I leave here."
# seb "Oh, yeah, of course! That's a nice idea."
# seb "Have you had cats before?"
# Choiceseb "Have I had cats before? (all get the same reaction)"
# -No, but I'd do my research
# -Yeah; I've got some experience
# -So many that it's almost weird
# seb "Cool. I wanna know all Doom's kids are gonna be in safe hands."

# seb "I mean, obviously I'll have to give most of them away, once they're old enough."
# seb "But I'd like to keep one or two around the shop, y'know?"
# seb "To take over Doom's duties someday."
# s3_mc "Have you decided what you're gonna call them?"
# seb "Oh man, I haven't even thought about it."
# Choiceseb "You should name the kittens after‚Ä¶"
# -Your exes
# -Islanders
# s3_mc "Like, if one of the kittens can explain in detail why it thinks wet food is objectively better than biscuits, you can call it Bill."
# seb "Sure. And 'Harry' can be the kitten with the most relentless ambition in its eyes."
# seb "And 'Genevieve' if one of the kittens turns out to be‚Ä¶"
# seb "No, I can't think of a joke for Genevieve."

# -Music genres
# s3_mc "You've already got Doom! You could call the kittens Grunge, Sludge, Thrash‚Ä¶"
# seb "Adorable."
# seb "I'm glad we can talk about music."
# seb "I tried to make a joke about shoegaze to AJ the other day, and she thought I was talking about gay people who are into shoes."
# seb "Viv thought it was funny, though."

# He sighs.
# seb "Viv's just nice. Like it comes naturally to her."
# seb "I wish I knew how she does it."
# Choiceseb "Seb thinks Genevieve is 'nice‚Ä¶'"
# -She's not nice to me
# -Yeah, she's a sweetheart
# s3_mc "The kind of person who'd wait for your bus with you in the cold type of thing."
# seb "Yeah, exactly."

# -I think you just fancy her
# He stares off into space for a while, chewing his lip.
# seb "You might be onto something there."
# seb "It's kinda hard to tell."

# seb "She's the kinda girl I wish I could fall for, y'know? But that wouldn't be very‚Ä¶me."
# s3_mc "You go for bad girls, basically."
# seb "I guess I do."
# seb "Well, hey. If I was good at choosing girlfriends, I wouldn't be here in the first place."
# s3_mc "True."


# nicky "Y'know I was thinking about my little sister Rachel again earlier."
# nicky "Thinking about when she was at uni and she did a runner the day before an exam."
# s3_mc "What?"
# nicky "Yeah, she'd found out her boyfriend at the time was cheating on her. And she knew she was going to fail anyway."
# nicky "So she jumped on a bus to Aberdeen to see her ex, and spent the weekend partying with him and his mates."
# nicky "Don't tell anyone.She only told me because she needed to borrow money for the bus home."
# s3_mc "And this is the sister you think I have a lot in common with?"
# nicky "Well, not that stuff, necessarily. I mean, does it sound like the kind of thing you'd do?"
# Choiceseb "Would I drop everything to travel across the country on an impulse?"
# -I would never do that
# s3_mc "I couldn't be that irresponsible. I don't know if I'd even want to."
# nicky "Yeah, that's probably a good thing."

# -I've totally done that
# s3_mc "Yeah, that's classic me, to be honest."
# nicky "Ah, I had my suspicions."

# -I'd like to try it someday
# s3_mc "It's exciting to think about."
# s3_mc "I just haven't ever made that leap before."
# nicky "Well hey, it's never too late to start being spontaneous."

# nicky "You know, I think you'd be a good influence on Rach. I know what I said on our first night here‚Ä¶"
# nicky "How you kind of remind me of her. Just in the way you tend to be surrounded by chaos."
# nicky "And I stand by that, but now we've been here a few days, I wanna make one small disclaimer."
# nicky "You're like Rachel, except you can actually handle the drama going on around you."
# nicky "So even when it's always kicking off, you tend to take it in your stride a lot better."
# nicky "Whereas she's still a bit of a big kid. You're like a more mature version, if that makes sense."
# Choiceseb "Nicky says I'm more like a mature version of his sister‚Ä¶"
# -But I still don't feel properly grown-up
# s3_mc "Sometimes I look around and realise‚Ä¶ I'm an adult now? With a job?!"
# nicky "Have you hit that point yet where people you went to school with start getting married and having kids?"
# s3_mc "Ugh, yes! It's so weird!"
# s3_mc "It feels like just yesterday we were all taking our GCSEs."
# nicky "You'll get used to it."

# -Yeah, I've always been old for my age
# s3_mc "I think I'm more emotionally mature than most other people my age."
# nicky "Definitely. Though, to be fair, that's not a high bar."

# -Please stop comparing me to your little sister
# s3_mc "It's weird. Next you're gonna be and helping me with my maths homework."
# nicky "Alright. That was the last time, I promise. (you get üòÇ with Nicky)"

# nicky "Besides, you'll probably be a totally different person by the time you leave here."
# nicky "With everything that's already happened, and more on the horizon, most likely."
# nicky "It could, like, open up whole new parts of yourself you didn't even know about."
# Choiceseb "WIll Love Island change me?"
# -No, I'm already who I want to be
# -Yeah, I'm doing some growing here
# s3_mc "Yeah, of course. I think this could end up being a turning point in my life."
# s3_mc "Especially if I end up leaving with someone I have real feelings for."

# -Only by making me more famous!
# s3_mc "It's me who changes the world, not the other way round."
# nicky "Good point."

# s3_mc "What about you? D'you think you're changing by being here?"
# nicky "I hope not. Why would I wanna mess with perfection?"
# s3_mc "Yeah, yeah, okay."


# Ater Iona's tent is finally up, Elladine beams a smile at the rest of you and claps.

# iona "Um‚Ä¶ what?"
# At that moment, one of the ropes holding her tent up comes loose. Half the tent collapses in on itself.

# -Our one!
# B/H/Cam/aj "We can't vote for ourselves, babe. (you get üòÇ with Bill/Harry/Camilo /AJ)"
# s3_mc "I don't care. We have the best tent!"
# B/H/Cam/aj "You're right about that, but‚Ä¶"
# B/H/Cam/aj "We actually need to vote for someone."
# B/H/Cam/aj "I think Elladine and Nicky's is the best, personally."

# elladine "We agree, too. (If she's/Nicky's not BFF)"
# elladine "Nicky's right. (if Nicky is BFF)"

# Text: Congrats Elladine and Nicky! The other Islanders have voted your tent as the best. As a reward, you'll get to pick the food for tonight's meal. #foodforthought
# s3_mc "We didn't win‚Ä¶"
# B/H/Cam/aj "You've seen our tent, right?"
# It leans at an odd angle, amongst the rest of the Islanders' tents.
# (if the tent is good and/or chose the gem choice to ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù it):

# s3_mc "We won!"
# B/H/Cam/aj "Of course! Our tent does look proper good."

# miki "Just like how MC did with her tent up! (if you chose the gem choice to ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù the tent)"
# nicky "What's the point? It's not like we'll be sleeping here tonight."
# You pull out your phone.
# Text: Islanders, tonight you will be camping out in your tents! #intense #intents
# nicky "Oh. Well, that answers that."
# Choiceseb "Camping outdoors?"
# -Hell yeah!
# s3_mc "It's going to be so cosy!"

# -But what about the bugs?
# B/H/Cam/aj "Don't worry about them, babe. Just stay in my arms."
# B/H/Cam/aj "I'll keep you safe."

# -You can get up to a lot in a tent‚Ä¶ (MC coupled with Camilo is missing)
# B/harry "They're a bit cramped, if I'm honest‚Ä¶"
# B/harry "But I'm still up for this."
# aj "Yeah! Once me and a friend drained this guy's keg of beer at Reading."
# aj "He had no idea!"
# s3_mc "I was thinking something a little sexier‚Ä¶"
# aj "Oooh‚Ä¶"

# elladine "This is so exciting! I can't wait to camp out tonight. It's been years since I last went camping."
# Choiceseb "Camping is the‚Ä¶"
# -Best way to connect with nature
# miki "Camping's one of the reasons I bought my barge. (You get ü•∞ with Miki)"
# miki "I wouldn't want to live in a tent forever, but I knew a normal house wasn't my thing."
# seb "Sounds like a good way to have all your stuff sink to the bottom of a river‚Ä¶"
# miki "Why would it sink?"
# Seb shrugs.
# seb "Pirates."
# s3_mc "In a Cambridge canal?"
# seb "Canal pirates."

# -Perfect way to ruin a good weekend
# s3_mc "Why do people want to sleep on the ground?"
# miki "What? It's so peaceful, though!"
# seb "Nah, MC's got the right outlook."
# seb "It's called a B&B. I'll take an actual mattress any day."
# miki "Don't you camp for festivals, though?"
# seb "Yeah, but I don't sleep much."

# -Leading cause of tent related injuries
# bill "Well, yeah? Where else would you get tent related injuries?"
# The others think.
# aj "In a‚Ä¶ tent factory?"
# bill "Oh, that's true. In fact, I bet they're way more dangerous than just camping."
# s3_mc "Yeah, but how many people work in a tent factory versus how many people go camping?"
# bill "Also a good point."
# camilo "This is well hard to answer."
# iona "Then maybe we‚Ä¶ don't?"

# elladine "I'm so lost in this conversation‚Ä¶"
# elladine "But I don't care. Let's grab some bedding so we can do all the camping things!"
# elladine "Shame we don't have marshmallows‚Ä¶"

# "And so, with their tents erected, our Islanders are ready for tonight's big camp out."
# "Except for Iona, whose tent skills have made me scared to go near any pylon in Scotland."
# "At least MC and Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ don't have to worry about their tent!"
# "I've never seen such a sturdy structure, and I once spent two years in Alcatraz."
# "Worst sightseeing tour of my life‚Ä¶"
# "Coming up!"
# "Things get spooky‚Ä¶"

# "Previously, our Islanders put their construction skills to the test‚Ä¶"
# aj "I can't find the hole!"
# "By pitching some tents in the back garden."
# elladine "Run!"
# "You can't run through a campsite, Elladine!"
# "You can only ran."
# "Why?"
# "Because it's past tents."
# "Prime time content here, folks."
# "Tonight on Love Island‚Ä¶"
# "The Islanders have a big camp out in their erected tents."
# B/H/Cam/aj "This is the first time we get to spend the night together‚Ä¶"
# B/H/Cam/aj "Alone!"
# "Need I say more?"

# You're in the dressing room trying to find something to wear for tonight's camp out.
# thought "What am I going to wear to sleep outside?"
# Someone knocks at the door.
# B/H/Cam/aj "MC, are you up here?"
# s3_mc "I'm in here."
# Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ shuffles in, closing the door behind him/her.
# He's/She's holding a top in his/her hand.
# B/H/Cam/aj "If you want, you can borrow one of my tops to sleep in tonight, like, as an extra layer."
# B/H/Cam/aj "That's like a cute coupley thing that girls like, right?"
# B/H/camilo "Steal their boyfriend's clothes."
# s3_mc "Totally."
# aj "Sharing each other's entire wardrobe is a given when you're with a girl, right?"
# aj "And guys too, to be fair."
# aj "But it's harder to share jeans and stuff."
# s3_mc "I'm gonna steal all your clothes!"
# B I wore this thing the first time I ever plonked a tile on a roof.
# harry "I always wear this under a shirt when I go for an interview."
# camilo "Whenever I go to Jiu Jitsu, I always have this on under my gi."
# s3_mc "That's really sweet."
# s3_mc "But also totally gross."
# camilo "It's been washed!"
# aj "I wear this all the time under my hockey gear."
# s3_mc "That's really sweet."
# s3_mc "But also totally gross."
# aj "It's been washed!"
# B/H/Cam/aj "It's kinda my lucky top, I guess."
# B/H/Cam/aj "I haven't actually worn it yet here."
# B/H/Cam/aj "But I think it would look cute on you."

# Choiceseb "Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ wants me to wear his lucky top!"
# -Yeah, I'd love to wear it (gem choice)
# Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ smiles and hands it to you.
# B/H/Cam/aj "Sweet. (you get üòç with Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ)"
# B/H/Cam/aj "I'll let you get changed."
# He/She looks away as you slip on the top.
# bill "Perfect!"
# bill "Well, it's a bit baggy‚Ä¶"
# bill "But I find oversized clothes so sexy on a girl."
# harry "Dang, girl."
# harry "That t-shirt suits you to a T."
# camilo "Oh, damn."
# camilo "That looks so hot on you."
# aj "It looks so cute on you."
# aj "Way cuter than it looks on me!"
# B/H/Cam/aj "I'm never getting that back, am I?"
# s3_mc "Nope."
# B/H/Cam/aj "Fair enough, gorgeous."
# B/H/Cam/aj "Let's go down and find the others."

# -Nah, I'm alright
# B/H/Cam/aj "Aw, are you sure?"
# Choiceseb "It does look cosy‚Ä¶"
# -Go on then, you softie (gem choice)
# -I prefer my clothes
# B/H/Cam/aj "Oh, okay, fair enough!"
# thought "Even if I don't want to wear his/her top, I still want to look good for Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ."
# thought "This'll be our first night together, after all!"
# MC outfit changes to sleepwear
# thought "Hmm. Got to leave some things to the imagination, though, right?"
# B/H/Cam/aj "Not stressing about what to wear to bed, are you, MC?"
# B/H/Cam/aj "You know I think you look hot regardless."
# s3_mc "Thanks, babe."

# B/H/Cam/aj "Wow, this is going to be the first time, we, like, properly get to spend the night together‚Ä¶"
# B/H/Cam/aj "Alone!"
# Choiceseb "This is our first night alone together‚Ä¶"
# -I can't wait to get hot and sweaty in the tent
# B/harry "Yeah, we better get loads of blankets to keep warm."
# B/harry "Oh, wait‚Ä¶ did you mean‚Ä¶"
# You raise an eyebrow.
# B/harry "Ah, right. Gotcha."
# Cam/aj "I'm literally a human radiator so, yeah."
# Cam/aj "You bet it's going to be hot in there."
# s3_mc "That's not exactly what I‚Ä¶"
# Cam/aj "Oh, you meant‚Ä¶"
# He raises his/her eyebrows.
# B/H/Cam/aj "Well, that can be arranged."

# -I'm kinda scared of the dark‚Ä¶
# B/H/Cam/aj "Hey, don't worry about it."
# B/H/Cam/aj "I'll be there."
# B/H/Cam/aj "And if anything does happen‚Ä¶"
# He/She grabs something from the dresser.
# B/H/Cam/aj "I'll defend you with this magic hairbrush!"
# s3_mc "Will that help?"
# B/H/Cam/aj "Absolutely. It works every time."

# -I will miss sleeping in a room full of people
# B/H/Cam/aj "If that's what floats your boat‚Ä¶"
# s3_mc "It does."
# s3_mc "I love being surrounded by many, many, sleeping bodies."
# B/H/Cam/aj "Well‚Ä¶ I'm sure we'll only be spending one night in the tent."

# (if you won the challenge):
# B/H/Cam/aj "We'd better go choose what we want to eat at our camp out!"
# (if you didn't win the challenge):
# B/H/Cam/aj "I hope Elladine picks out some good stuff to eat for our camp out‚Ä¶"
# You both head down to the kitchen.
# You head downstairs. Elladine and Nicky are also in the kitchen.
# (If you chose the gem option to wear Bill's/Harry's/Camilo's/AJ's shirt)
# Elladine points at your top.
# elladine "That's not your top, is it?"
# elladine "I don't recognise it."
# s3_mc "It's Bill's/Harry's/Camilo's/AJ's."
# B/H/Cam/aj "I lent it to her."
# Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ beams at you.
# B/H/Cam/aj "Looks cute, doesn't it?"
# elladine "So cute."
# nicky "You guys are the cutest."
# B/H/Cam/aj "We try. "
# Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ squeezes your hand affectionately.
# nicky "When can we start wearing each other's clothes, babe?"
# elladine "I don't share clothes, babe."
# nicky "Aw."
# (if you won the challenge)
# B/H/Cam/aj "So, what food shall we have?"
# Choiceseb "What food should we choose for our camp out?"
# -Sausages and beans
# H/Cam/aj "We can try to cook it over the fire."
# bill "Yes!"
# (if you chose the gem choice to have breakfast with Bill on day 2)
# bill "Like we had on our first sort of breakfast date! (you get ‚ù§Ô∏è with Bill) (if chose the gem choice to have breakfast with Bill on day 2)"
# s3_mc "Yeah, just like that!"
# bill "Sausages and beans are the best part of the fry up."
# Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ gets some tins of beans out from the cupboard and packs of sausages out of the fridge.
# B/H/Cam/aj "We can do veggie sausages for you, MC."
# s3_mc "Aw, you star. Thanks, babe!"

# -Marshmallows
# B/H/Cam/aj "Reminds me of being a kid."
# Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ rummages in a cupboard in search for some marshmallows.
# B/H/Cam/aj "We've got veggie marshmallows for you, MC."
# s3_mc "That's awesome. Thanks, babe!"
# B/H/Cam/aj "Got some."
# Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ puts them on a counter, along with some wooden sticks to roast them.

# -Noodle soup(MC coupled with Harry is missing)
# B/Cam/aj "Soup?"
# s3_mc "Yeah. Specifically noodle soup."
# s3_mc "Nothing better than sitting around the fire pit sipping a mug of hot soup."
# B/Cam/aj "Well, when you put it like that it sounds so wholesome."
# Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ starts getting out some tins of soup and some mugs.

# (if you didn't win the challenge):
# elladine "Right. Time to plan out the food."
# nicky "I think we should go for marshmallows!"
# elladine "Nice choice."
# Nicky rummages in the cupboards and the fridge.

# nicky "Do we need to get the campfire started?"
# elladine "Surely we'd just use the fire pit since, like, it's already there."
# nicky "But it's not camping without a proper fire!"
# s3_mc "Maybe this is safer. No one will lose an eyebrow."
# B/H/Cam/aj "Nah, someone has to light it, surely."
# nicky "Well, how hard can it be?"
# elladine "I'll show you."
# elladine "I'm a proper fire starter."
# You, Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ and Elladine head over to the firepit.

# The warm red hues of the flames illuminate everyone's faces as they gather around the firepit.
# A grill has been suspended over the flames.
# You pile up everything you brought from the kitchen by the fire.
# elladine "Aw, it's already on."
# seb "You can't turn a fire on, Elladine."
# elladine "Well, I don't know?"
# elladine "This place could be hooked up to all sorts of magic."
# M/G/I/seb "It was already on when we got here. I set the grill up, though."
# elladine "Miki/Genvieve/Iona/Seb is a sorcerer."
# Miki/Genevieve/Iona/Seb gives Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ a melancholy look.
# Elladine smiles at her sympathetically.
# elladine "Thanks, hun."
# Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ edges closer to you and squeezes your hand reassuringly.
# (if you chose the gem choice to ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù the tent; when coupled with AJ only if Seb isn't BFF)
# M/G/I/seb "Your tent looks great, by the way."
# s3_mc "I wanted it to look nice for tonight."
# M/G/I/seb "Course you did."
# genevieve "OK, for real. I'm starving!"
# genevieve "What food did you guys bring over?"
# (If you didn't win the challenge):
# elladine "Marshmallows!"
# (If you won the challenge):
# s3_mc "We brought sausages and beans! / We brought noodle soup! / We brought marshmallows."
# genevieve "Aw, brilliant."

# (if you picked noodle soup):(MC coupled with Harry is missing)
# harry "I always forget this stuff can come in tins. "
# harry "Much quicker to just cut open the little packets."
# harry "I'm all about low effort cooking."

# (if you picked sausages and beans):
# You put a frying pan on the grill and slap the sausages into the sizzling oil.
# Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ plops the baked beans into a saucepan.
# bill "Sausages and beans is, like, camping perfection."
# The sausages and beans have been sizzling in a pan on the fire for a few minutes.
# Genevieve pokes the sausage.
# genevieve "It doesn't look all that cooked to me‚Ä¶"
# Camilo sticks a fork in it and holds the sausage up.
# camilo "It's all pink and floppy."
# miki "That's the name of your sex tape, Camilo."
# Camilo playfully nudges her.
# iona "Give it a minute, babe."
# Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ is warming his/her hands by the fire.
# s3_mc "You cold, Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ?"
# B/H/Cam/aj "Nah, not majorly."
# B/H/Cam/aj "But if you want to warm me up I'm not going to object."
# Choiceseb "I should‚Ä¶"
# -Cuddle up to him/her by the fire
# s3_mc "Come here, you."
# You both snuggle up closer together.
# Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ leans his/her head onto your shoulder and you wrap your arms around him/her, enveloping him/her in your embrace.
# B/H/Cam/aj "You're so comfy, babe."
# B/H/Cam/aj "Like, I could literally fall asleep right here, right now."
# Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ pretends to snore.
# iona "Have you put Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ under a sleeping spell?"
# s3_mc "I'm afraid so."
# You start moving your fork towards Bill's/Harry's/Camilo's/AJ's plate.
# s3_mc "I wanted a second helping of sausages and beans."
# Elladine laughs. Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ sits up straight again.
# B/H/Cam/aj "I'm awake! I'm awake!"

# -Whisper what I want to do to him/her tonight in his ear
# thought "That ought to warm him/her up."
# You lean in to Bill's/Harry's/Camilo's/AJ's ear and whisper.
# s3_mc "Tonight‚Ä¶"
# s3_mc "I have something I want to do to you‚Ä¶"
# B/H/Cam/aj "Firepit.sausages.a.Oh.yeah."
# s3_mc "It involves‚Ä¶"
# You slowly stroke his/her leg with your finger.
# s3_mc "One hundred percent less clothes and for us to be very‚Ä¶"
# s3_mc "Very‚Ä¶"
# s3_mc "Close."
# B/H/Cam/aj "You're so naughty."
# You smile seductively.
# s3_mc "You have no idea."

# -Put some more logs on the fire
# You get some logs from the side and pop them on the fire to keep it roaring, taking care to not knock the sausages.
# B/H/Cam/aj "Good idea, babe!"
# Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ busies himself warming his/her hands on the fire.
# You start moving your fork towards Bill's/Harry's/Camilo's/AJ's plate.
# elladine "MC!"
# Bill's/Harry's/Camilo's/AJ's head whips round.
# B/H/Cam/aj "Hey!"
# s3_mc "Damn, I thought I distracted you! I wanted a second helping."

# seb "Don't think I've ever been, like, camping before."
# genevieve "Aw, really?"
# genevieve "I spend a bit of every summer working in a tent."
# seb "Oh yeah. You're, like, a doctor for campers sometimes aren't you?"
# Genevieve shrugs.
# genevieve "Close enough. Festival goers."
# seb "You must see some right states."
# seb "Mosh pits, fights, and all sorts."
# Iona stands up and starts dishing out the sausages and beans. Everyone quickly tucks in.
# iona "Yeah, do you ever get a chance to, like, unwind?"
# iona "It must be so hectic."
# genevieve "I love sneaking a cheeky second to go and watch some grime artists."
# genevieve "A good bop always puts me in a good mood."
# genevieve "And during my lunch breaks I go and see some stand up comedians in the comedy tents."
# genevieve "So, yeah. I think I'm pretty lucky in my job."
# genevieve "It's hard work but it's the highlight of the year"

# (if you picked noodle soup):
# You put a pan on the griddle and pour in half a dozen tins of noodle soup.
# s3_mc "Pass the mugs out, Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ."
# B/H/Cam/aj "Sure, babe."
# The soup begins to boil. You smell the air as it rises.
# Nicky helps stir the pot.
# nicky "It looks about ready."
# B/H/Cam/aj "I'll help serve it up."
# Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ ladles soup into everyone's mug.
# nicky "Cheers, Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ."
# elladine "Yeah, thanks for that!"
# nicky "Noodle soup was such a good shout."
# Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ sits back down beside you, cradling the warm mug in his/her hands.
# B/H/Cam/aj "Looks like it's going down well with the others."
# Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ slurps up a noodle in the soup.
# It twists and turns before disappearing into his/her mouth.
# Choiceseb "Hmm, noodle soup‚Ä¶"
# -Do a lady and the tramp thing with the noodle
# s3_mc "Shall we do a lil slurpin with the noodle thing‚Ä¶"
# s3_mc "Like they do on Lady and The Tramp?"
# You slurp up a noodle and look at him/her with twinkly puppy-dog eyes.
# B/H/Cam/aj "OK. You are the boss!"
# Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ takes out a long noodle and puts one end in his/her mouth.
# You take the other end in yours and slurp.
# The noodle piece disappears into your mouth and your lips meet.
# You only kiss for a moment, but it is a soft and tender one at that.
# iona "Oh my word, you two. Get a room."
# iona "Or a tent."
# s3_mc "Sorry, you lot."
# s3_mc "We're getting carried away."

# -Tie a knot in a noodle with your tongue
# You slip a noodle into your mouth and your tongue does acrobats inside.
# s3_mc "Tada!"
# You open your mouth and show Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ your tongue knotting abilities.
# B/H/Cam/aj "Um, ok wow."
# B/H/Cam/aj "That's a real tongue twister."
# He/She leans over and whispers into your ear.
# B/H/Cam/aj "I hope we get to put that tongue to good use later."
# You wink at Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ.
# s3_mc "You bet."

# -Just have a good slurp of the soup
# You take an indulgent gulp of the soup. You can feel your whole body warming up.
# s3_mc "Hmm, this is so tasty!"
# B/H/Cam/aj "Yeah, it's delicious. "

# Nicky helps himself to another mug from the hot bubbling pot.

# (if you picked marshmallows):
# You pass out the sticks and the marshmallows to everyone.
# iona "I feel like I'm a kid again, camping up on the mountains with my aunt and uncle."
# She pretends to cheers your stick.
# iona "Cheers!"
# (if Elaldine picked marshmallows):
# Elladine passes out the sticks and the marshmallows to everyone.
# iona "I haven't had these since I went camping as a kid! My aunt and uncle would always bring them up the mountains with us. They're lush."
# seb "Yeah, banging choice, Elladine."

# You reach over to the fire and turn the marshmallow around the stick until it goes crispy golden colour.
# Out of the corner of your eye you see a small bright flame on the end of Bill's/Harry's/Camilo's/AJ's stick.
# B/H/Cam/aj "Ah!"
# He/She lets it drop into the pit. The sticky mess gets quickly engulfed by the flames.
# s3_mc "Perfect marshmallow roasting, hun. It's completely obliterated."
# B/H/Cam/aj "I don't have any technique whatsoever."
# B/H/Cam/aj "Yours looks amazing."
# Choiceseb "My marshmallow does look pretty good‚Ä¶"
# -Eat it all in one go
# You chomp down on the marshmallow.
# s3_mc "Nomnomnom."
# The sugary sweet gooey goddess bursts through your mouth as you bite through the crispier parts.
# It's a little hot, but you bite through the pain.
# B/H/Cam/aj "Nice?"
# s3_mc "Delicious."
# B/H/Cam/aj "That is one lucky marshmallow."

# -Feed Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ the marshmallow
# You take the stick out of the fire and poke it towards Bill's/Harry's/Camilo's/AJ's face.
# s3_mc "Want a bite of my marshmallow? "
# Bill/Camilo looks at it a little suspiciously.
# B/camilo "I've never actually had them before but, like, yeah sure."
# B/camilo "Let's try them."
# Bill/Cam bites the marshmallow off your stick.
# B/camilo "Oh, okay. That's actually, like kinda weird but good."
# B/camilo "It's so sticky!"
# Harry/AJ gives you some sexy eyes and licks his/her lips.
# H/aj "You don't have to ask me twice."
# He/she bites the marshmallow off your stick and licks his/her lips.
# H/aj "Mmm! Delicious."
# H/aj "I love marshmallows."

# -Set it on fire
# You leave the marshmallow on the flames.
# s3_mc "And it burns, burns, burns‚Ä¶"
# B/H/Cam/aj "Um‚Ä¶"
# s3_mc "The marshmallow of fire!"
# s3_mc "The marshmallow of fire‚Ä¶"
# It catches fire.
# Elladine laughs at you from across the circle. (if you chose the clue about setting the kitchen on fire)
# elladine "MC is at it again. (if you chose the clue about setting the kitchen on fire)"
# elladine "We know what you're like around fire! (if you chose the clue about setting the kitchen on fire)"
# Your marshmallow melts off your stick and is obliterated by the flames.
# B/H/Cam/aj "Proper roasted that one is."
# You both laugh and grab another marshmallow to eat.

# miki "Camping always makes me think of this time I made this, like, marshmallow tower."
# camilo "You what?"
# iona "Come again?"
# miki "Oh, yeah, I did a whole YouTube series."
# miki "It was called Camping With Friends!"
# miki "In one of the videos we had this competition to see who could model the funniest thing out of marshmallows."
# Camilo starts stacking the marshmallow on top of each other on the stick, trying to fashion his own marshmallow tower.
# Elladine bursts out laughing.
# elladine "That's a very phallic looking tower indeed."
# camilo "It's proper pink and floppy."
# miki "That's the name of your sex tape, Camilo."
# Camilo playfully pokes her with the stick of marshmallows.
# seb "Yum."

# Genevieve looks around the Villa. She seems a little on edge.
# genevieve "I could have sworn I saw something moving over there."
# seb "Could have been the Villa's Ghost."
# genevieve "Er, what?"
# elladine "Ghost story time!"
# Elladine gets out her phone, turns on the torch, and shines it under her chin.
# Genevieve looks a little concerned while the others start to make spooky noises.
# elladine "It was a cold and lonely night."
# seb "Pretty sure it's dark and stormy."
# genevieve "I love that cocktail‚Ä¶"
# camilo "That's the name of your sex tape, Viv."
# elladine "Fine! It was a hot and steamy night‚Ä¶"
# B/H/Cam/aj "That's more like it‚Ä¶"
# elladine "The Islanders were just settling down to a nice cup of‚Ä¶"
# Choiceseb "A nice cup of‚Ä¶"
# -Hot chocolate
# miki "Oh, damn you MC."
# miki "Now I'm craving a hot chocolate."
# iona "Yeah, me too."
# elladine "Miki. Focus."

# -Fear of my enemies
# elladine "A cup of fear?"
# s3_mc "Specifically, the fear of my enemies."
# Seb and Iona snort loudly with laughter.
# s3_mc "What? I thought this was meant to be a scary story."
# iona "You can't cup fear."
# seb "I don't know."
# seb "If I leave my cups out for too long they start wearing fuzzy green jackets."
# seb "And that can be a little haunting."
# elladine "Ugh. Grim, but fine."

# -Kombucha
# iona "Kombucha?"
# s3_mc "Yeah, that can be quite a scary drink to be honest because you don't know if you're going to like it."
# seb "I second that."
# elladine "OK‚Ä¶"

# elladine "The Islanders were just settling down to a nice cup of fear/hot chocolate/Kombucha."
# elladine "When all of a sudden‚Ä¶"
# Seb jumps up.
# seb "There was a shiny demon!"
# He points to the grass.
# seb "In the middle of the lawn."
# Genevieve squeals.
# genevieve "Ah!"
# iona "That's not very ghostly though."
# genevieve "Demons are scary."
# seb "Yeah, and it's a hot and steamy night."
# seb "Perfect climate for a wild demon to appear."
# iona "I guess that explains the shininess."
# elladine "OK, all of a sudden a shiny demon popped up."
# harry "And it said‚Ä¶"
# Choiceseb "What did the demon say to us?"
# -Welcome to Clown Island
# camilo "Aw, I love clowns."
# s3_mc "Yeah, and on Clown Island do you know what we eat for breakfast, lunch, and dinner?"
# genevieve "Wha.. what?"
# s3_mc "Souls."
# s3_mc "I think it might be soul eating time."
# s3_mc "Said the shiny demon."

# -I'm seeking fresh souls
# s3_mc "I'm seeking fresh souls, said the shiny demon."
# Everyone is silent except the crackle of the fire.
# Miki stands up and shouts.
# miki "Back off, you evil shiny demon."
# miki "You're not taking my friend's souls."
# genevieve "Yeah! You tell em'."
# M/G/I/seb "The demon just grinned and said 'I may have sinned but there's no need to push me around.'"
# M/G/I/seb "And then, the demon latched onto Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ and said‚Ä¶"
# M/G/I/seb "I've got him/her first so you can do your worst."
# M/G/I/seb "He's/She's going underground!"
# You and Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ look at Miki/Genevieve/Iona/Seb, a little afraid.
# elladine "Go along with it, Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ."

# -Hey, I'm the new Islander!
# s3_mc "Hi, I'm the new Islanders, said the demon."
# M/G/I/seb "Now that is terrifying."
# Miki/Genevieve/Iona/Seb stands up.
# M/G/I/seb "Yeah, and it's come to steal Harry's/Bill's/Camilo's/AJ's soul from MC!"
# Miki/Genevieve/Iona/Seb winks at you cheekily.
# s3_mc "No, not Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ!"

# B/H/Cam/aj "Save me, MC."
# Choiceseb "Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ soul is about to be stolen by the demon!"
# -Cling on to him tightly
# You quickly grab onto Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ.
# s3_mc "I'll protect your soul!"
# miki "Aw, you're like, soul mates."
# B/H/Cam/aj "Thanks, MC."
# He/She hugs you back, tightly. (you get üòç with Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ)
# B/H/Cam/aj "And by the power of a cuddle the demon was shattered into a million pieces!"
# iona "A demon shattering cuddle?"
# iona "Really?"

# -Offer Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ for a price
# s3_mc "Sorry, shiny demon. You can't just have Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ."
# Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ smiles at you.
# s3_mc "Nothing is free these days."
# s3_mc "You've got to pay."
# s3_mc "I want to make a profit."
# Bill's/Harry's/Camilo's/AJ's face drops into a frown.
# B/H/Cam/aj "Oh. (you get üôÅ with Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ)"
# seb "Looks like your soul's about to be sold, Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ."
# seb "But the demon has forgotten his pin and Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ costs more than the limit on contactless."
# seb "So the demon sulks away back to the underworld, sparing Bill's/Harry's/ Camilo's/AJ's soul for another day."
# B/H/Cam/aj "Phew."

# -Throw the cup of fear/the hot chocolate/the Kombucha on it
# s3_mc "I'll throw my cup of fear/hot chocolate/Kombucha over the demon."
# miki "The metaphorical cup of fear from MC's enemies/hot chocolate/Kombucha makes the demon flea into the hot and steamy night."

# Genevieve cheers and claps excitedly.
# genevieve "Yay!"
# genevieve "Be gone, shiny demon!"
# seb "Unfortunately, the shiny demon left behind a ghostly presence‚Ä¶"
# seb "Which will haunt the Villa for years and years to come."
# The wind picks up a little causing the shadows of the dancing flames to flicker.
# Choiceseb "The tale is over‚Ä¶"
# -Well, that wasn't a very scary story
# iona "Yeah, I agree."
# iona "There is nothing scary about a villain that just pops up without any kind of build up."
# iona "It is the anticipation of it that makes it frightening."
# elladine "We were drinking a cup of fear/hot chocolate/Kombucha! That was the setup."
# iona "Terrifying."
# seb "Watch out‚Ä¶"
# seb "Iona Hitchcock is about."
# Iona rolls her eyes.

# -What happens next? I want a sequel!
# elladine "Yeah! We could do a whole novel about it."
# miki "Write the book and then make it into three separate movies ultimate gains."
# elladine "I'm too sleepy for that."

# -Can we get into the tents already?
# Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ raises his/her eyebrows in surprise. Miki bursts out laughing.
# miki "Did a story about a shiny devil make you feel‚Ä¶"
# miki "Erotically charged?"
# You wink?
# s3_mc "Nah, I'm just feeling hot and steamy tonight."

# You hear a light snoozing. Nicky has dozed off on Elladine's lap.
# camilo "Aw, he's so cute when he's sleeping."
# iona "I'm knackered too."
# genevieve "But it's getting pretty dark‚Ä¶"
# elladine "Yeah, bed time, I think."
# genevieve "Hm, yeah."
# She looks around at the empty loungers.
# harry "Genevieve, the demon isn't actually real."
# (MC coupled with Bill/Camilo/AJ):
# harry "It'll be fine, hun, I'm right with you! "
# Genevieve begrudgingly follows Harry into their tent.
# M/G/seb "I'm actually going to go and sleep inside, I think."
# B/Cam/aj "Are you sure you're OK?"
# M/G/seb "Yeah, no way I'm sleeping in a tent by myself."
# s3_mc "OK hun, whatever works for you."
# Miki/Iona/Seb heads inside the Villa.
# genevieve "I think I'm going to skip the camp out and sleep inside."
# genevieve "Don't fancy sleeping in a tent on my own in the dark outside."
# aj "You can share with me and Seb."
# aj "We're not going to be making anything go bump in the night."
# AJ laughs. Seb rolls his eyes.
# seb "Truth to be told, yeah, if you want to share with us you totally can."
# seb "It might be squashed but it beats sleeping the Villa on your own."
# Genevieve puts on a brace face.
# genevieve "Alright, alright."
# genevieve "That's real sweet of you guys."
# They all squeeze into one tent together.
# B/H/Cam/aj "Right, shall we get in our tent?"
# (If you chose to give Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ a pebble as a key to the tent):
# B/H/Cam/aj "Sorry, our new home."
# Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ opens his/her clenched fist and reveals the little pebble.
# s3_mc "Aw, you kept our keys!"
# B/H/Cam/aj "Yeah, of course."
# B/H/Cam/aj "Can't have any shiny demons trying to break in, can we?"
# s3_mc "No way, not in our home."
# Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ unzips the tent and you clamber into your new home for the night.
# (if you chose ‚ÄúSay something dirty‚Äù in the challenge‚Äù):
# s3_mc "Sure, let's get in there and get filthy."
# He/She unzips the tent. You take Bill's/Harry's/Camilo's/AJ's hand and lead him/her in.
# (if you chose the gem choice to upgrade the tent and/or your tent is good):
# You and Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ huddle in the tent. It's super cosy.
# (if you didn't choose the gem choice to upgrade the tent and your tent is bad):
# You and Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ huddle in the tent. It's a bit chilly.
# (If you chose the gem choice to ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù the tent):
# B/H/Cam/aj "It looks like someone is serving up some camping eleganza."
# B/H/Cam/aj "You did such a good job of doing it up."
# s3_mc "Thanks babe."
# (if you didn't choose the gem choice to ‚Äúupgrade the tent):
# B/H/Cam/aj "We're serving camping realness in here."
# thought "Hmm, we've got sleeping bags and a duvet‚Ä¶"
# Choiceseb "Do I want to cuddle up to Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ or put some distance between us?"
# -Spread out the duvet and cuddle
# You throw the duvet across you both.
# Bill/Harry/Camilo quickly snuggles up to you, enveloping you in his arms.
# B/H/Cam/aj "Huddle close before we get too cold."

# -Get in the sleeping bag on your own
# You get in your sleeping bag. Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ does the same.

# -Zip two sleeping bags together and share
# s3_mc "Let's zip two sleeping bags together."
# You fiddle with the zips of the two bags until they're joined as one big bag.
# B/H/Cam/aj "You think we'll fit?"
# s3_mc "Of course!"
# You slide into the sleeping bag beside him/her. It's not very roomy, but it's super cosy.
# B/H/Cam/aj "OK, this is comfier than I thought."

# You lay beside each other, listening to the chirping of crickets.
# B/H/Cam/aj "Honestly, I can't get over how, like, close we've gotten in such a short time."
# Choiceseb "Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ thinks we're getting closer!"
# -Yeah, I agree, it's lovely
# B/H/Cam/aj "It's like we've known each other for ages, isn't it?"
# s3_mc "Totally."

# -We could get even closer‚Ä¶
# B/H/Cam/aj "Oh, yeah?"
# Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ winks at you.
# B/H/Cam/aj "I'm sure that could be arranged."

# -This tent is pretty cramped
# B/H/Cam/aj "Yeah, I guess it is!"

# B/H/Cam/aj "It's only been a few days and we're already on a sort of holiday away from home."
# s3_mc "How?"
# B/H/Cam/aj "That's what camping feels like to me, even if it's in your back garden."
# B/H/Cam/aj "We're literally already on holiday‚Ä¶so, it's like we're on a holiday away from a holiday!"
# Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ smiles at you, blushing a little.
# B/H/Cam/aj "It's so funny that this is the first time we've, like, actually slept alone."
# Choiceseb "This is the first time me and Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ have slept alone together!"
# -It's about time, right?
# B/H/Cam/aj "Totally."

# -We should take advantage of it
# B/H/Cam/aj "You think?"
# s3_mc "For sure."

# -It feels weird without the others!
# B/H/Cam/aj "Yeah‚Ä¶"
# B/H/Cam/aj "Isn't it weird how we now find it weird not having a bunch of other people sleeping next to you?"
# s3_mc "Yeah, totally."

# (if you chose the gem choice to wear Bill's/Harry's/Camilo's/AJ's top)
# Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ gently strokes the sleeve of his top.
# B/H/Cam/aj "By the way, you look so cute in my top."
# s3_mc "Thanks for lending it to me."
# B/H/Cam/aj "Any day."
# B/H/Cam/aj "You wear it better than me."
# B/H/Cam/aj "Are you sleepy?"
# bill "Or would you like to stay up talking and maybe‚Ä¶"
# He shakes the tent a little.
# bill "Test to see if this tent is as strong as it looks?"
# harry "Or do you maybe want to‚Ä¶"
# Harry raises his eyebrow.
# harry "Get up close and personal?"
# camilo "Or shall we chill out in this tent.."
# camilo "And maybe take advantage of this alone time?"
# aj "Or do you want to stay up all night talking and‚Ä¶"
# aj "Doing other stuff?"
# Choiceseb "Do I want to go to sleep or spend some time with Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ?"
# -Stay up with Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ (gem choice)

# -Go to sleep
# s3_mc "I'm so tired."
# B/H/Cam/aj "I am too. But I think it's a shame to waste such a private space like this‚Ä¶"
# Choiceseb "For once we're not in a shared bedroom‚Ä¶"
# -Stay up (gem choice)
# -Go to sleep
# s3_mc "I think I'll just got to sleep."
# B/H/Cam/aj "That's fair enough!"
# B/H/Cam/aj "It's pretty late."
# B/H/Cam/aj "Night, gorgeous."
# You both settle down and drift off to sleep.

# Gem choice:
# s3_mc "We can stay up!"
# B/H/Cam/aj "Cool. (you get üòç with Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ)"
# B/H/Cam/aj "We can have a proper good chat."
# B/H/Cam/aj "It's hard chatting at night with loads of people in the same room, isn't it?"
# s3_mc "Yeah, for sure."
# You huddle closer to Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ.
# Bill takes your hands in his and pulls you towards him, so close you can count his eyelashes.
# Choiceseb "I'm so close to Bill‚Ä¶"
# -Kiss him fast
# You lean in and press your lips against his, clutching at his stubbled jaw.
# He returns the kiss with the same passion as his hands run down your body.

# -Kiss him slow
# You stand on tiptoes and brush your lips against his. He leans into it, but you pull back until you're only just maintaining contact.
# You control the pace and he follows your lead until you're kissing fully and deeply. His hands run down your body.

# -Cuddle up to him
# You turn and press your head into his chest. It's warm and firm and you can hear his heart beating.
# Bill lightly strokes your arm with his hand.

# s3_mc "I like your hands."
# bill "Grew them myself."
# s3_mc "Good job. They feel very‚Ä¶reliable."
# bill "They've gotta be. I'm a roofer, after all."
# bill "And I like to make stuff."
# bill "My granddad's a cabinet maker, and we sometimes make furniture together."
# s3_mc "Like, from scratch?"
# bill "Yup. We'd just finished a piano stool before I came here."
# bill "He knows a guy, who knows a guy, who gets decent timber for cheap. It's great to be around him."
# Choiceseb "Bill makes furniture with his grandad‚Ä¶"
# -That's really sweet
# You stroke his fingers with yours.
# s3_mc "I think it's adorable."
# bill "I don't know about that, but I do really enjoy spending time with the old fella."
# bill "And it's not just that he's got good stories or bants, or whatever."
# bill "He's a solid person."
# bill "His head's bursting with common sense."
# s3_mc "That's exactly what I was picturing."
# s3_mc "I can imagine you being like that when you're old."
# s3_mc "Dispensing wisdom to the young'uns."
# He smiles broadly.
# s3_mc "That's the dream, innit?"

# -What else can you do with your hands?
# You stroke his fingers with yours.
# s3_mc "What else can you do with your hands?"
# bill "Is there something in particular you want me to do?"
# You wink.
# s3_mc "There might be."
# bill "Just to be clear, we're talking about sex, right?"
# s3_mc "You're so upfront, I love it."
# s3_mc "Yes, we're talking about sex."
# He grins.
# bill "Good to know we're on the same page."

# -Does your dad ever help?
# bill "My dad's not much of a woodworker. He'd sometimes take me round to his plumbing jobs, though."
# bill "He and my grandad have these big long arguments about whether plumbing or carpentry was harder."
# bill "It's all in good fun. Just their way of saying 'I love you'."
# s3_mc "So, that's where you get it from."

# s3_mc "What's your favourite thing you've ever made?"
# He thinks about it for a moment.
# bill "Let me see‚Ä¶"
# bill "It'd have to be the spice rack we made."
# s3_mc "Erm‚Ä¶it took two of you to make a spice rack?"
# bill "It was the first thing my granddad showed me how to make. We didn't used to speak much before that."
# bill "He really warmed up showing me all the proper tools and stuff."
# bill "The spice rack is useless, obviously, but it was all about spending time together. We're proper mates now."
# s3_mc "That's lovely. But what did you mean by 'it's useless'?"
# bill "Well, most spices are unnecessary, you know?"
# bill "All you need is salt, pepper, curry powder, oregano and cinnamon. Everything else is just showing off."
# Choiceseb "Bill thinks most spices are unnecessary‚Ä¶"
# -Agree with him
# s3_mc "Tell me about it. Everything these days is cumin this, fennel that. It's just not necessary."
# bill "I knew you'd get it!"
# bill "Wait, are you taking the piss?"
# s3_mc "Not at all!"
# bill "Oh, good."

# -Argue the point
# s3_mc "Doesn't that exclude like 90% of the world's cuisine?"
# bill "Might do, but it works for me."
# s3_mc "But you could be really missing out!"
# bill "It's never really bothered me‚Ä¶"
# s3_mc "One day I'm going to try and change your mind."
# s3_mc "There are some cracking spices out there."
# He thinks for a moment. You can almost see the wrestling match going on inside his head.
# bill "Yeah, sure. Why not?"
# s3_mc "Great."
# bill "I wouldn't do this for anyone else, you know?"

# -Laugh it off
# s3_mc "You and your opinions!"
# s3_mc "I feel like a fish that doesn't see the bait until it's been hooked."
# s3_mc "Or maybe it's something else that's got me hooked."
# You put your arms around him.

# He puts his arms around you and gives you a squeeze.

# Harry smoothes out his hair with one hand. His biceps bulge pleasingly.
# harry "Alone again‚Ä¶"
# Choiceseb "Alone with Harry‚Ä¶"
# -Kiss him
# You close the distance between you and brush your fingers down the side of his face.
# harry "H-"
# Before he can start talking, you put a finger to his lips, then lean in and kiss him.
# His arms envelop you. You melt into each other's lips and for a few moments, that's all there is.

# -Tell him to kiss you
# You gaze at him seductively.
# s3_mc "Kiss me."
# He wastes no time in moving towards you, kissing you hard on the mouth. He softly bites your lower lip.
# His arms envelop you. You melt into each other's lips and for a few moments, that's all there is.

# -Admire his body a bit more
# He chuckles softly.
# harry "What?"
# s3_mc "Just admiring the view."
# Harry smiles confidently and flexes a little more.
# You fan yourself.
# s3_mc "Could you be any hotter?"

# harry "When I'm with you, I feel like the coolest guy in the world."
# harry "Like a super-spy. 'The name's Zh≈çng. Harry Zh≈çng.' (in some playthroughs it's ‚ÄúMitchell-White‚Äù instead of Zh≈çng)"
# Choiceseb "Harry feels like a secret agent when he's with me‚Ä¶"
# -You don't have the snappiest name for it
# -Do I get to be a spy too?
# harry "Of course! Harry and MC a crime-fighting, super-spying duo."
# harry "We can both get proper sweet tuxedos."
# s3_mc "Or we could both wear sleek, sexy silk dresses."
# harry "Do you think I could pull it off?"
# s3_mc "I think you'd rock it."

# -Does that make me the femme fatale?
# harry "I'm not sure I'd last very long if you were the enemy."
# harry "I'd be like 'see ya MI6, I'm off to join MC and take over the world'."
# You pretend to pout.
# s3_mc "So you wouldn't even put up a fight?"
# You run a finger slowly down his chest.
# s3_mc "Shame."
# Harry grins.
# harry "Maybe just for show."

# s3_mc "Oh, you know what else spies have?"
# s3_mc "Cool gadgets."
# harry "Like a pen that's also a smoke bomb!"
# Choiceseb "Or a‚Ä¶ (no further reactions)"
# -Lighter
# -Water bottle
# -Torch

# Choiceseb "That's also a‚Ä¶ (no further reactions)"
# -Tranquiliser dart
# -Poison dispenser
# -Laser
# harry "I dunno, sounds‚Ä¶ dangerous."
# s3_mc "That's the point!"
# harry "I meant dangerous for you."
# harry "I can see a hundred ways it could go wrong‚Ä¶"
# harry "Besides, you're forgetting the best gadget of all."
# s3_mc "What's that?"
# harry "The one in my pants."
# Choiceseb "That was‚Ä¶ "
# -Confusing
# -Sexy
# harry "What would a spy be without his dry wit?"
# s3_mc "'Dry wit' might be pushing it, babe."


# -Hilarious
# harry "Hmm, I was going for 'suave'."
# harry "But hilarious is a decent runner-up prize."
# s3_mc "It's actually the first prize."

# You both laugh.

# Camilo runs his fingers down your arm and looks into your eyes. He winks.
# Choiceseb "He looks good‚Ä¶"
# -Tease him
# -Kiss him
# You lean in and kiss him, feeling his strong arms wrap around you and pull you in tighter.
# The subtle, spicy scent of his aftershave washes over you.
# camilo "You're bloody fantastic."
# s3_mc "You're pretty great yourself."

# -Tease him and then kiss him
# You stroke his hair, and when he leans in for a kiss, you kiss his forehead.
# camilo "Keeping me on my toes?"
# You respond by grabbing his chin and pulling him in for a fierce, passionate kiss.
# camilo "Whew, mamacita. That was amazing."

# Camilo twirls a bit of your hair in his finger.
# camilo "MC, can I ask a question?"
# s3_mc "Sure."
# camilo "Did you worry about coming in here? The Villa, I mean."
# s3_mc "In what way?"
# camilo "Well, like leaving your family behind."
# Choiceseb "Was I worried about leaving my family?"
# -Not at all
# s3_mc "I hadn't really thought about it, if I'm honest."
# s3_mc "I guess I don't have that kind of relationship with them."
# camilo "But won't they miss you?"
# s3_mc "Maybe?"
# s3_mc "But I'm sure they'll last a summer without me!"

# -Maybe my grandparents
# s3_mc "Yeah, my grandparents especially."
# camilo "I get that. Mine are in Colombia and I miss them a lot."
# s3_mc "But the rest of my family will be fine without me for a summer!"

# -Yeah, definitely
# s3_mc "Totally. I was a bit of a mess at the airport, haha!"
# camilo "I knew you'd feel me."
# camilo "I think about mine every day. Wondering how they're getting on and that."

# s3_mc "You're really close with yours, right?"
# camilo "Yeah, but more than that, they really depend on me."
# camilo "What with my dad being ill, and me being the oldest kid‚Ä¶"
# camilo "I dunno, I just feel really responsible for everyone."
# Choiceseb "Camilo feels responsible for his family‚Ä¶"
# -I'm sure they appreciate it
# s3_mc "They're really lucky to have you."
# s3_mc "I'm sure they appreciate everything you do."
# camilo "Yeah‚Ä¶ It doesn't feel that way all the time."
# camilo "Don't get me wrong, I love my family to bits, but sometimes it feels like it's just one thing after another, you know?"

# -That's really noble
# s3_mc "I admire that. I like a man who takes care of his family."
# camilo "It's not like I'm some kind of hero, though."
# camilo "I just did what had to be done. There wasn't anyone else to step up after my dad got sick."
# s3_mc "That takes courage."
# camilo "Maybe. I hadn't really thought about it, if I'm honest."

# -That must be tough
# s3_mc "That's gotta be tough on you."
# He shrugs.
# camilo "I dunno, I never thought about it really."
# camilo "After my dad got sick, I was the one who had to step up."
# camilo "Just the way it goes, innit."

# camilo "Just the way it goes, innit"
# You put your arms around his neck. You feel the hard muscles in his shoulders relax a little.
# s3_mc "Well, I'm definitely glad you came here, mister."
# camilo "Yeah, lucky you, eh?"
# s3_mc "Seriously, though. You deserve to have a bit of fun and be happy."
# camilo "You're a big part of that, MC."
# s3_mc "Which one? Having a bit of fun or being happy?"
# camilo "Huh? Which one? What do you-"
# camilo "Oh, you're taking the mickey."
# camilo "You're bad!"
# s3_mc "I try."

# aj "I can't tell if you're sending me kiss-you-right-now signals or not‚Ä¶"
# Choiceseb "Am I sending signals telling AJ to kiss me?"
# -Nah, I don't want to right now
# -Yes! Kiss me, AJ
# s3_mc "Yeah, I am!"
# s3_mc "Kiss me, AJ!"
# She closes her eyes and leans in to kiss you.
# You kiss passionately, your hands bring her closer towards you.
# It is urgent and frantic. You can't get enough of each other. You can't get close enough.
# She pulls away, you're both breathless.
# s3_mc "That was‚Ä¶"
# aj "Yeah‚Ä¶"
# aj "That was some kiss."
# aj "Wow."
# She smiles, catching up with her breath.
# aj "You take my breath away, MC."
# aj "I'm normally awful at reading signals so I'm glad I got this one right."

# -Pucker your lips and kiss her
# aj "I'll take that as a yes."
# You lean in to kiss her.
# You kiss passionately, your hands bring her closer towards you.
# It is urgent and frantic. You can't get enough of each other. You can't get close enough.
# She pulls away, you're both breathless.
# s3_mc "That was‚Ä¶"
# aj "Yeah‚Ä¶"
# aj "That was some kiss."
# aj "Wow."
# She smiles, catching up with her breath.
# aj "You take my breath away, MC."
# aj "I'm normally awful at reading signals so I'm glad I got this one right."

# aj "I think flirty signals just fly right past me sometimes."
# aj "Do you notice it when people flirt with you?"
# Choiceseb "Do I pick up on flirty vibes?"
# -Are you flirting with me right now?
# -Yeah, I can always tell
# aj "I wish I had that."

# -No one flirts with me
# aj "Don't be silly. I know people flirt with you, MC!"
# aj "I'm one of them."

# aj "My friends always tease me and say they don't want to take me out of goal because I'm, like, so oblivious to obvious passes."
# aj "Even though I'm apparently a really big flirt."
# aj "How can you tell if someone likes you or not?"
# Choiceseb "How can I tell if someone is into me?"
# -Cast a spell
# -Body language
# s3_mc "It's all about the body language."
# aj "Really?"
# aj "What should I look out for?"
# s3_mc "If it's open and they're leaning towards you that's a good sign."
# aj "Open like when someone's on the field and you pass the ball to them?"
# s3_mc "Yeah, that works."

# -Just ask them
# aj "Yeah, to be honest, that's the way I usually go about it."
# aj "If I like them, I don't want to hang around waiting for them to maybe make a move."

# aj "At least with us it's pretty clear how we feel about each other."
# aj "I much prefer uncomplicated and straightforward things, do you get me?"
# Choiceseb "AJ likes things to be simple‚Ä¶"
# -I love the thrill of the chase
# -I'm just a simple love machine
# aj "Me too! (you get üòç with AJ)"

# -I've been told I can be a bit chaotic
# aj "Oh, well, life can make us a bit like that sometimes."

# aj "And you know what?"
# aj "I'm totally dating my fantasy."

# You can hear giggling from the other tents. Someone moans a little too loud.
# camilo "This really reminds me of the times I used to pitch a tent with my girl in my back garden to get away from all my family."
# He laughs, raising his voice a little so the other Islanders can hear him.
# camilo "Except my family weren't all around me getting it on as well."
# Someone laughs. Someone else moans.
# B/H/aj "Sounds like the others are getting it on in their tents!"
# Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ grins.
# Choiceseb "Should me and Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ do bits?"
# -Nah, we should just cuddle
# B/H/Cam/aj "Come here."
# He/She wraps his/her arms around you, spooning you close.
# B/H/Cam/aj "I love a good cuddle."
# B/H/Cam/aj "You're by far the best person I've got to spoon."
# s3_mc "Oh, really?"
# B/H/Cam/aj "Yeah."
# B/H/Cam/aj " MC:The Best Spooner is what should be on your CV."
# You smile and snuggle further into Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ.

# -Yes! Get on top of him/her and do bits
# You straddle Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ and interlock your fingers with his/her, gently holding him/her down on the tent ground.
# harry "Easy tiger!"
# Harry balances up on his elbows and leans up to kiss you.
# You lean down to his level and kiss his neck.
# harry "You're so sexy."
# Bill gestures for you to come down to him and kiss him.
# His hands squeeze your thighs as you kiss his neck.
# bill "I love having you on top of me like this."
# Camilo pulls you close to him and kisses you.
# His hands stroke your lower waist.
# camilo "Damn. Girl, you are so hot."
# AJ tugs lightly on your wrists, pulling you closer to her.
# She kisses you urgently.
# aj "I can't get enough of you."
# The cool air doesn't stop you from stripping off.
# B/H/Cam/aj "Woah."
# As you move your hips Bill's/Harry's/Camilo's/AJ's breath quickens.
# B/H/Cam/aj "Oh, woah."
# Choiceseb "I should‚Ä¶"
# -Go lower
# -Go higher
# -Go deeper
# You move slowly on top of Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ, trying not to dismantle the tent in the process.

# Outside, you hear the rustling of the other tents.
# Bill pulls you closer and moans into your ear.
# bill "Let's give the others a proper show."
# He rolls you onto your back and kisses your neck.
# harry "Oops."
# harry "I'll try and be a little bit quieter‚Ä¶"
# He kisses you, hard. 
# camilo "I wish it was just us right now."
# camilo "I would be so much louder if it was."
# aj "This is so hot."
# aj "Don't let anything distract you."
# You start to explore his/her body with your lips and tongue.
# Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ moans slightly louder than you expected.
# seb "Can someone turn it down?"
# elladine "Yeah, some of us are trying to sleep!"
# (MC coupled with one of the boys):
# elladine "Can someone turn it down?"
# elladine "Some of us are trying to sleep!"
# iona "Not all of us."
# You roll off Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ and lie back in a fit of laughter.
# B/H/Cam/aj "Oops."
# You cuddle up next to each other.
# Bill's/Harry's/Camilo's/AJ's heat radiates around you.
# B/H/Cam/aj "That was pretty intense."
# s3_mc "Because we're in tents?"
# B/H/Cam/aj "Yeah. I know. Weak."
# You roll your eyes and hit him/her with a pillow.
# B/H/Cam/aj "Nah, I'm kidding."
# Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ sounds a little out of breath.
# B/H/Cam/aj "No jokes about that."
# B/H/Cam/aj "That was amazing."
# s3_mc "I know, I try."
# Bill/Harry/Camilo/AJ rolls onto his side and kisses your cheek.
# B/H/Cam/aj "You don't even have to try, babe."
# B/H/Cam/aj "You're always amazing."

# Something rattles the sides of your tent, waking you up from your slumber.
# genevieve "Psst."
# genevieve "MC?"
# Genevieve pokes her head through the door.
# genevieve "Um, hun‚Ä¶"
# Choiceseb "Genevieve?"
# -Give us some privacy
# -Are you alright?
# s3_mc "What's up, hun?"

# -I thought you were the demon!
# You back away a little.
# genevieve "I'm not the demon!"
# genevieve "But‚Ä¶"

# -Sorry, were we too loud? (Only available if you did bits in the tent)
# genevieve "I mean, earlier, yeah. You were pretty loud."
# s3_mc "Oops, my bad."
# genevieve "It's chill, hun, I don't blame you for wanting to take advantage of this alone time."
# genevieve "But that's not what I was coming over here for."

# genevieve "Sorry, I just could have sworn I heard something, like, moving around out here."
# s3_mc "It could have been a bird or the wind."
# genevieve "Yeah. A bird."
# s3_mc "Or maybe one of the others had to go to the loo?"
# genevieve "You're probably right. I just hate how quiet and dark it is."
# genevieve "Anyway."
# genevieve "I'll leave you to your sleep‚Ä¶"
# Genevieve reluctantly pops her head out of the tent.
# thought "Hmm‚Ä¶"
# thought "I wonder what she heard?"

# "While these lot are all going bump in the night, I've made my own campsite on my floor for me, myself and I."
# "I don't have any sausages and beans though."
# "But I've got my floor."
# "And you know what? The floor is so supportive."
# "It's not like walls. It's there for you right where you need it."
# "Walls are always getting in my way."
# "Anyway, let's leave our Islanders 'sleeping' outside."
# "Coming up‚Ä¶"
# "The Islanders are in for a few surprises."
# genevieve "Wait, those weren't there when we went to bed."
# genevieve "Who is in those tents?"
# "Maybe a shiny demon?"
# "They're quite rare, actually."
